<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears necessary to explain the
somewhat abrupt commencement of this Essay on
Classification.&nbsp; It was written, and even a great part of it
printed, as a continuation of my defence in the case of Allen
<i>v.</i> Dutton; but during the progress of printing, I soon
became weary of this defensive attitude; and I also soon
discovered, that so far from the ex-parte and perfectly false
statements which were reported of the trial having any injurious
influence, they rapidly expedited my success.&nbsp; Thanks to the
zeal and exertion of all those friends who were anxious to
counteract the effect which these falsehoods were calculated to
make against me; they spoke from personal experience, and with
all the ardour which gratitude and justice could inspire.</p>
<p>The design, therefore, of publishing it as a part and
continuation of my defence, was gladly abandoned.&nbsp; Many of
the first sheets, however, containing no improper allusion to
this case, <a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>remain: I mention this, because it accounts for that
which might otherwise appear an abrupt commencement, especially
to those who have not previously read that defence.&nbsp; On this
account, I shall bind up that defence, (without additional
expense) at the end of this Essay, for those who may wish to have
this connexion before them.&nbsp; It is necessary, also, to
inform the reader of the origin of this Essay, for another
reason, in order that he may understand (and I trust, also, under
such circumstances, he will excuse) why there is so much personal
minuteness in describing our system of procedure and exertions,
which could not, and would not, otherwise, have been obtruded on
the public.</p>
<p>But if, after being thus justified and compelled to come forth
in my defence, the matter should be found useful, either to
myself or mankind, it would be foolish affectation to seem to
feel shame and regret by too anxiously apologising and explaining
the origin and consequent peculiar complexion of this
publication, or of those which may follow in regular
succession.&nbsp; And it is a truth, that it has increased my
zeal and strengthened my resolve to prosecute that most useful of
all studies, the study of mind,&mdash;its errors and diseases,
with, I trust, so ardent a love of the truth, that I earnestly
pray I may be enabled to trace every error to its source; for so
much does the ground appear <a name="pagev"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. v</span>to me to be untrodden, that I pray
also, that opportunity, life, health, and encouragement may be
given me to complete the work I have to do, that, however slender
my talents may be, I may yet feel that they have not been given
me altogether in vain.</p>
<p>In explaining in this Essay all the plans necessary to the
moral and physical purposes of an efficient system of
Classification, I have had slightly to introduce many cases and
subjects to illustrate my present purpose; and feeling that I had
not done them or myself justice, I have said, on these occasions,
I shall hereafter treat this case or subject more amply in that
part of the work in which they will be more directly and
specifically introduced.</p>
<p>Having thus incidently introduced many subjects without their
being under any specific head or title, I shall, to enable the
reader to form some conception of the matter, give in the
contents something like a minute dissection of the whole.</p>
<p>From all this, and also from what I say in my former work on
Insanity, as well as in Allen <i>v.</i>&nbsp; Dutton, it will be
seen that I have been induced to give pledge after pledge so
repeatedly, that it becomes a serious matter, &ldquo;partaking of
the nature of a solemn obligation;&rdquo; if, therefore, I fail
to exert myself to redeem these pledges, I cannot have the excuse
of <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>those
who promise without even intending to perform.</p>
<p>In the preliminary remarks of Allen <i>v.</i> Dutton, I say at
the conclusion, &ldquo;I find I must do even more than this,
(meaning the defence); for my defence would still be imperfect
without a short statement of my views on the insane.&nbsp; For
this purpose, I propose to write the following Essays:</p>
<p class="gutindent">1st.&mdash;On Classification, and Tables in
Illustration. <a name="citationvi"></a><a href="#footnotevi"
class="citation">[vi]</a></p>
<p class="gutindent">2nd.&mdash;The different Divisions, into
which I divide the Insane.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3rd.&mdash;Their General and Specific
Character.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4th.&mdash;The Correspondence between Causes
and Effects.</p>
<p class="gutindent">5th.&mdash;That the Study of Mind will
evolve the Principle of Universal Generalization.</p>
<p class="gutindent">6th.&mdash;Their Moral and Medical
Treatment.</p>
<p class="gutindent">7th.&mdash;A Selection of Cases in
Illustration.</p>
<p>By this I shall be able to give a more full and perfect
understanding of the peculiar character and proper treatment of
this particular case; and by which will be seen, though
imperfectly, something of those principles, and of that spirit
which has pervaded the whole of our conduct to all those
entrusted to our care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do all this, in connexion with the above <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>case, would
not be right, were I influenced by any improper spirit; but as my
conviction is confirmed by experience, that these unjust
persecutions, provided we use them rightly, are for our good, I
feel in no danger of indulging in any spirit, but a spirit of
gratitude and forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From all this, (whatever variation I may make in the plan as I
proceed) as well as from what I say in my first work on Insanity,
where the same principle and mode of procedure is adopted, it
will be seen that my task is not a slight one.&nbsp; In the
preface to that work, I say,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many subjects, not usually included in
works of this kind, will be introduced; but as my reasons for
doing so will best explain themselves in due course, and as one
subject will be introductory to another, it is unnecessary to
mention them now, particularly as it might excite critical
objections, which I would rather wish to disarm than pretend to
brave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without presuming on the experience, knowledge, or the
materials I may possess, of this I am confident, that so long as
I am conscious that the love of truth is my pole-star, so long
will my faith continue firm in this, that with patience and
perseverance, and the love of truth for our guide, scarcely any
man&rsquo;s powers are so limited but he may hope to acquire some
clearer views, or perhaps make some discoveries <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>in the
matters he has undertaken to investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The objects of my enquiries are very numerous, and
involve so many either undiscovered or unadmitted truths, which
are so closely connected with subjects of inquiry the most
interesting, that I have adopted this slow and humble plan of
proceeding for the present, and have suspended, for a while, my
first purpose of publishing a systematic treatise on
insanity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is intended that each publication shall contain one
subject, at least, in some measure complete, so that each part
may have its distinctive title, and be had separately.</p>
<p>The study of mental philosophy, of which insanity is a very
important part, is, of all studies, provided we are on the road
where truth is the guide, the most useful to our moral
state.&nbsp; This belief was the first motive which induced me,
now more than thirty years ago, to direct my medical attention to
this most radically-important, though hitherto-neglected branch
of the profession, as well as to whatever seemed best calculated
to make me understand the sources of all erroneous and extreme
views, and which a series of painful circumstances through life
have excited and continually strengthened; but it is not
necessary to state them: I may, however, mention that, as early
as 1807, I visited lunatic asylums <i>con </i><a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span><i>amor&eacute;</i>, and that in 1816, 1817, 1818, and
1819, I was engaged in lecturing on Mind and its Diseases.&nbsp;
Before this time, I had no conception that I should ever be
exclusively devoted to this department of the profession, which
<i>circumstances</i> at that period forced upon me.&nbsp; I
trust, however, that I have endeavoured to profit by the
opportunities which this new situation afforded me of more fully
comprehending the nature of mind, its connection with life and
organization, its diseased manifestations, and of ascertaining
the best modes of co-operating with nature in the removal of
them; and, at any rate, it is certain that, for the purpose of
lessening the miseries and increasing the comforts of those under
my care, I, for the most part, have sacrificed every personal
consideration.</p>
<p>From 1819 to 1824, I continued medical resident and
superintendant of York Asylum; and on leaving it, it was voted
unanimously, &ldquo;That I deserved the thanks of the Governors,
for my constant and successful efforts in establishing and
perfecting the mild system of treatment there.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
again engaged in lecturing, at the request of several
institutions, on Mind and its Diseases; soon afterwards, in 1825,
I fixed on this situation, as the best adapted of any part of the
country about London which I saw, (and I spent several weeks in
the examination; <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>nor have I since that time seen any I like better) to
carry into effect my views of the treatment of the insane, either
as respects the recovery or the comfort of recent or confirmed
cases; for here, together with domestic comfort, diversity of
occupations and amusements suited to their various states, the
retirement, pure air, and sweet scenery around, afford ample
scope for walks, without annoyance, and apparently without
restraint; which, with judicious moral and medical management,
combine many acknowledged requisites to assist the disturbed and
diseased mind to regain its tranquillity, and in many cases to
resume its healthy tone of action.</p>
<p>I shall only add, that all these views have been amply
justified by the beneficial results on those entrusted to my
care; so much so, that these results and my success have greatly
exceeded my most sanguine anticipations.</p>
<p>I here gladly close these personal remarks, which have been
forced from me, for self is a subject which it is seldom wise and
always dangerous to introduce.</p>
<p>It only remains to notice another peculiarity in this essay,
which is, that of having introduced some animadversions on
legislators whose minds are not sufficiently pure or
comprehensive to enable them to avoid the common error of
overlooking general principles, and not to <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>presume to
judge and draw conclusions from the hasty, partial, and erroneous
views they have acquired on the subject on which they
legislate.&nbsp; This has often led to, or been combined with,
that great selfish view of making themselves and their property
the chief good, not considering the real objects of legislative
care, nor &ldquo;that life is more than meat, and the body more
than raiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; This it is which has corrupted all our
laws, especially our criminal code, which was a system of legal
murder, not justice, and a perfect scandal to the nation.</p>
<p>The same faults are visible in all they have done for the poor
insane.&nbsp; They have given an undue and exclusive
consideration to property and to the few extreme and violent
cases; treating them and <i>all who have the care of them as
criminals</i>.&nbsp; To live amongst them, appears to be deemed a
crime, for which neither goodness nor talent can atone.&nbsp; All
which must, in various ways, have an injurious influence.&nbsp;
To banish these errors is to better the treatment of the
insane.&nbsp; This conviction is my excuse for introducing the
subject, and which makes me anxious to prove, from experience,
that such extreme cases hardly have any existence at all under a
proper system of treatment; and, that at all events, this liberal
treatment <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>materially lessens the horror and danger usually
conceived to attend these places.</p>
<p>Insanity is, no doubt, a terrible visitation; but why should
we allow a false and unreasonable horror to increase it? and why
should we thus sever our sympathy from a disease which more than
any other requires it?&nbsp; The medicinal virtues of the fruits
of charity are best proved amongst them.&nbsp; Grant that the
disease arises from some remote or proximate ill-directed mental
states.&nbsp; Why should we have more horror of insanity, than
many other consequences of ill-regulated minds?&nbsp; To me, the
foul ward of some large public Hospital, is incomparably more
horrible and loathsome.&nbsp; Such direct consequences of
wickedness present the object before us in an aspect that makes
it difficult for us to exercise any feelings of commiseration
towards them.&nbsp; Not so the insane.&nbsp; But these are views,
however, into the consideration of which I shall not enter in
this place; but I mention or rather hint at the diseases of other
organs, for the purpose of asserting that the reality and
appearance of the miserable state of the insane is not so
shocking as people imagine; but that still I allow it is an awful
visitation.</p>
<p>When the gloom and horror at present thrown around
establishments for the insane shall be cleared away,
Dante&rsquo;s inscription over <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>the gates of Hell, will be no
longer applicable to them,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Lasciate ogni
speranza, voi, ch&rsquo;entrate;&rdquo; <a
name="citationxiii"></a><a href="#footnotexiii"
class="citation">[xiii]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>this, or perhaps another passage from Euripides, has been
imitated by our Milton,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Here hope never
comes, which comes to all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They will be considered houses of cure, or hospitals for the
insane.</p>
<p>The erroneous and false impressions concerning the character
and state of the insane, will be corrected.&nbsp; The popular
impression, that they are all violent and vociferous, destructive
and dangerous, will be removed.&nbsp; Hitherto medical writers,
by selecting the most striking cases, have contributed their
share to this popular error.&nbsp; They have been led to do this,
partly because they are cases, which more naturally arrest their
own observation; but chiefly, because they are more easily
described, make a more interesting picture, and are the most
curable.&nbsp; A statement of the recovery of such patients,
though it may serve to exalt the writer in public estimation, is
wrong in itself, and very injurious in its influence; for it
increases the unreasonable horrors and false impressions
entertained about the insane, and propagates and perpetuates the
evils of which <a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>the public and legislature complain.&nbsp; They receive
impressions from extreme cases, which average about five per
cent. then speak and act just as if all the insane were in a
similar condition.</p>
<p>It would seem that these prejudices and horrors of the insane
exist in a much greater degree in this part of the kingdom than
they do in Yorkshire.&nbsp; There I was in the constant habit of
taking convalescent patients with me into family parties of the
first respectability; and members of these families were also in
the constant habit of visiting them as friends and acquaintances,
and of inviting them to tea and to spend the evening at their own
homes; and this practice, in most instances, had a very pleasing
and beneficial influence.&nbsp; This was the case with other
institutions; but I have not found, neither have some others
found, any such faith in, and sympathy for, the insane in this
part of the kingdom, but quite otherwise; and yet I am certain,
it is an example they cannot too soon imitate&mdash;its
beneficial influence will bring satisfaction to themselves, will
remove their prejudices, destroy their painful fears, and lessen
the chances of the calamity invading themselves.&nbsp; There is a
protection around those who are striving to alleviate the
distresses of others.</p>
<p>This difference, which I and others have <a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>experienced,
makes me more anxious &ldquo;to impress these views on others,
and especially on those around me, in order that I may not be
obliged, from too great a deference to the fears and prejudices
of those I most anxiously wish to conciliate, to abridge the
exercise and lessen the happy effects of a system which theory
and feeling have suggested and compelled me to pursue; and which
nearly twenty years&rsquo; experience and increased knowledge
have confirmed and justified.&rdquo; <a name="citationxv"></a><a
href="#footnotexv" class="citation">[xv]</a></p>
<p>So important have I considered just views of the insane, that
I have added an Appendix for the express purpose of exhibiting a
fair average of the general appearance of the insane.&nbsp; With
the same view, I have given a few portraits of such of these
cases as are now, either themselves, or their friends, dead, or
little known.&nbsp; I had the same principle in view in my first
publication, which induced me to give cases in regular rotation,
&ldquo;rather,&rdquo; as I there say, &ldquo;than the common mode
of making a selection of extreme ones, that I might not give a
distorted picture of the insane, nor add to the unreasonable
horrors and false impressions on their state, as this has, I am
convinced, been one cause of an improper spirit and conduct
towards them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>It is
scarcely necessary, after what I have already said in the
Appendix, again to guard the reader against the mistake of
supposing that the cases and treatment described in that Appendix
form any data or criterion for judging of the kind of cases and
treatment in my own private establishment.&nbsp; The medical
swing, for instance, is stated as having been useful, in some
violent cases of mania; but this was even then soon laid aside as
objectionable; but it would be worse than useless now, because,
under a system which does not cultivate the habitual exercise of
the vindictive passions, cases in which it was of use, no longer
exist.&nbsp; In fact, to have recourse to any means which
operates so much on the fears, whatever medical virtues it may
appear to possess, is adopting a principal which philosophy and
Christianity equally condemn.&nbsp; It ought ever to be the aim
of all persons <span class="GutSmall">IN POWER</span> to call in
no principle but that of the <span
class="GutSmall">OMNIPOTENCE</span> of <span
class="GutSmall">SYMPATHY</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">BENEVOLENCE</span>; and this <span
class="GutSmall">PRINCIPLE</span> is not to be excluded even from
those whose spirits are imprisoned in bodily evils and
diseases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Annual Review of Medicine
and Collateral Science for 1818, of the London Medical
Repository, the following notice is taken of these
Essays.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Philosophical Magazine the reader
will find a series of Essays by Mr. Allen; rich in ingenuity of
argument, and abounding in masterly views on the great subject of
chemical agency, as affecting changes in the modes of existing of
physical matter.&nbsp; These essays all go upon the principle,
that in every change of existence that matter is capable of
undergoing, caloric is given out or absorbed in the form of
either electricity, of galvanism, of caloric, or of light.&nbsp;
Respecting the important question which has recently agitated the
philosophical world, and which has been proposed as a prize in
one of the Societies abroad; viz. In what does the difference
consist between galvanism and electricity?&nbsp; Mr. Allen
observes, &lsquo;In electricity we contrive, by mechanical means,
to collect the loose and uncombined quantity from the earth and
surrounding medium; and this we do in circumstances in which it
has nothing to act upon, as free from moisture of any kind as
possible; in fact, from every thing readily soluble in heat or in
this power.&nbsp; I would therefore, he says, define electricity
to be the object of science which treats of the mechanical and
natural means of separating this <i>grand agent</i> from some of
its combinations, and of ascertaining its actions in this
state.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;In galvanism, on the other hand, this
solvent power, this electric fire, is produced in circumstances
in which it has <i>substances</i> to act upon; substances which
are most readily dissolved in it; substances, in fact, which seem
to form the grand medium between this <i>power and passive
substances</i>, and which are partially dissolved in it.&nbsp;
And hence I define galvanism as the electric fire, or <i>grand
agent</i>, only <i>partially</i> separated from its combinations;
by which I refer principally to oxygen and hydrogen.&rsquo;&nbsp;
After illustrating this principle, by referring to the
circumstances in which the chemical agency of galvanism appears
more conspicuous than that of electricity, he adds, &lsquo;thus
we perceive, that when <i>the grand agent of nature</i> is
<i>more perfectly</i> separated from its combinations it is <span
class="GutSmall">ELECTRICITY</span>; when partially separated,
<span class="GutSmall">GALVANISM</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of these
views and principles we have a more ample illustration and
defence as the author proceeds in his investigation; and the
whole inquiry is conducted with much philosophical acumen.&nbsp;
Hypothetical, of course, part of it must be: but how different
are the hypotheses of the present from those of former times,
when science was a sort of poetry, and dealt in abstractions and
inventions!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page2_1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>ESSAY<br />
ON CLASSIFICATION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> better to explain and
illustrate my ideas and views on the important subject of
Classification, I shall, in the first instance, give a brief
description of the present plans, arrangement, and manner of
proceeding, in my own establishment.</p>
<p>Fair Mead House, Leopard&rsquo;s Hill Lodge, and Springfield,
with appendages to each, constitute my present establishment at
High Beach; and I wish to have it most distinctly and most fully
understood, that they are simply for classification, of a more
general or more specific nature; and consequently, besides the
advantages derived from having three houses, I have (as far as I
could) made arrangements in each for this purpose.&nbsp;
Leopard&rsquo;s Hill Lodge, where I have more especially made
arrangements for the purpose of classification, consists of a
front, or what may be called the family portion of the house, and
galleries behind, with appropriate rooms for patients requiring
more restraint.</p>
<p><a name="page2_2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>To show
that these houses are merely for the purposes of classification,
I may mention, that there is no sort of difference in the three
houses, excepting that in the one generally and latterly
inhabited by ourselves, we prefer having those to whom our
individual and more immediate attention may be useful.&nbsp; The
same patients are even sometimes at one house, and sometimes at
another, according to their state; and sometimes for the mere
purpose of change.&nbsp; In fact, the greater part of our first
class of patients have been occasionally at Leopard&rsquo;s Hill,
and this with the knowledge and approval of their friends.</p>
<p>As I have published some hints on this point, and addressed
them to the Commissioners in Lunacy, I may be permitted, in order
to show I have long entertained the same views, to quote two or
three passages.</p>
<p>I there state, &ldquo;that two establishments on the same
grounds should be allowed and encouraged for the purpose of
Classification.&nbsp; My reason for this alteration, in the Act
relative to such places, is, that large and crowded houses are
decidedly objectionable, from the greater chance of noise and
disturbance, from their being less healthy, and from their
assuming more of a prison-like appearance, than of a family
mansion.&nbsp; With two, we can adopt a better and more complete
method of classification; <a name="page2_3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>and it is a consideration of very
great importance, that in one of them the proprietor and his
family should reside, and devote themselves to recent, partial,
slight, or convalescent cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I conceive this plan of two establishments for the purposes
of classification, to be of the highest importance, and essential
to the moral regulation, as well as to the cure of the insane, so
far from avoiding any investigation of either the principle of
their adoption, or their mode of management, I wish the most
exact knowledge to be obtained of the one, and invite the fullest
scrutiny of the other.</p>
<p>I would have not only two establishments in the same grounds,
but these sufficiently separated so as to prevent annoyance; and,
not only this separation, but I would have one to consist of a
male and female part, sufficiently separated from each
other.&nbsp; This arrangement I have at my own establishments,
which consist of Fair Mead House, and of Leopard&rsquo;s Hill
Lodge, for males, and Springfield for females, with appendages,
and separate cottages; and more especially, I would have each
house divided into a front and back part, and this front part so
contrived, that in appearance it should be sufficiently distinct
from the other, so that patients might feel, on recovery, that
removal to this part withdrew them from the more painful
associations of <a name="page2_4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>their past state, and afforded them solace and
encouragement; thus might their recovery be expedited, and the
chances of relapse lessened.&nbsp; In the domestic part of the
establishment, the proprietor and his family should reside.</p>
<p>In many cases, an entirely separate house is required.&nbsp; I
have known cases, the cure of which would have been apparently
blighted and blasted for ever, if they could not have been wholly
removed from, not merely the real, but the apparent, association
of former scenes and circumstances, and this without any change
in their servants and medical treatment and attendance, which is
also essential.&nbsp; Yet it is perfectly true, that in other
cases this association is not so injurious as most people would
imagine; the dawnings of the light of the understanding are, for
the most part, so gradual, and the mists of delusion so gently
steal away, that there would be a greater shock given by a sudden
transfer to rational scenes and real life, than by their
continuance in the place where they might be at the time.</p>
<p>I have often, with feelings of wonder and admiration, had
occasion to observe these occurrences.&nbsp; I have seen a
convalescent patient very much attracted by, and perfectly
delighted with, the strange remarks, speeches, and conduct of
another inmate, sometimes fancying it was meant purposely for his
amusement and diversion; and on whom, refined wit <a
name="page2_5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>would have
been lost, while the incongruous combinations of unguided
thought, which no wit or ingenuity can equal, appears, and is the
very essence of wit to him.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the truth of
all this, there are other cases,&mdash;cases of more sudden
convalescence, where all this would shock and horrify, and
produce a revulsion of feeling, most dangerous to them in their
delicate and fragile state, and perhaps permanently fatal to
their recovery.&nbsp; This is more particularly the danger in the
incipient stage of convalescence in some violent cases of mania,
<a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> and where I am quite certain delicate
and judicious attention have been essential; and where first,
perhaps, removal to the family part of the house, then removal
altogether to our own house, was apparently their salvation.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 106, <i>admitted April</i> 11<i>th</i>, 1820,
<i>aged</i> 65.</h3>
<p>This was one of the cases apparently saved by such timely
attention, and which I intend hereafter to describe more
particularly, for the purpose of illustrating both the medical
and moral treatment of many similar cases of insanity.&nbsp; I
shall, however, state so much of the case now, as will be
sufficient to show, that <a name="page2_6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>there is not only a critical period of
the disease, when judicious medical and intellectual attention
arrests and prevents its transition into another and equally
dangerous form of over-excitation, so dangerous, that if allowed
to take its course, it not unfrequently ends in dementia, but
also, and more especially to show, that in all cases our moral
treatment must have in view the nature of the existing causes, in
order that we may be able to adopt the most suitable methods of
counteracting their effects,&mdash;a part of treatment which has
hitherto been either wholly overlooked, or else exercised without
much knowledge and discretion; although I am certain it is of
great importance in the treatment of all curable cases of
insanity, and in many cases so important, that by such methods we
may ultimately succeed in removing these causes altogether; and
removing them, remove also the fear of their again (at any future
time) being allowed to have any baneful operation.</p>
<p>This person, who was a dissenting minister, had always been
reckoned by all parties, one who entertained gloomy views in
religion, and pushed these into extremes; his zeal was equally
violent and vindictive, and he besides possessed a mind with
every opposite quality in excess, and which had always, as far as
I could ascertain, been in a state of irregular and discordant
excitation; it is quite certain that during <a
name="page2_7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>many years
past, it had been habitually kept in a very painful and irritable
state, by several causes, and one more especially deserving
notice.&nbsp; He lived unhappily with his wife and her
friends,&mdash;instead of union and harmony, all was dislike and
contradiction, perpetual storms and altercations, which had just
before terminated in a separation between himself and them.</p>
<p>Thus, from the condition of his own unsettled and
ill-constituted mind, his gloomy and vindictive views in
religion, his variable and irritable temper, and from the nature
of the domestic excitement under which he had suffered most
severely, it was easy to trace the distressing and awful form of
his derangement to the causes which had produced it.</p>
<p>He was in a state of the most furious mania;&mdash;his was one
of the most violent and distressing cases I had ever seen.&nbsp;
It is impossible to convey any adequate conception of its
appalling nature.&nbsp; His language was obscene and vulgar, and
his horrible oaths and blasphemous speeches were poured forth for
some weeks without ceasing, and without sleep, with a volubility,
rapidity, and a voice so loud, and so foaming with passion, and
with such a frightful expression of countenance, that even those
most accustomed to such scenes, and of the strongest nerves,
trembled before him.&nbsp; He had a demoniac energy and
eloquence, which was, <a name="page2_8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>indeed, of the most harrowing and
awful kind.&nbsp; It was truly terrific! for even at a distance,
his voice sounded like a river escaping from some narrowed part,
and rushing with impetuosity over every thing that would impede
its course.</p>
<p>Had a short-hand writer taken down his ravings, it would have
proved that this picture is far from being an overcharged
one.&nbsp; One principle subject of his furious raving, was his
favourite doctrine of Election; or rather, perhaps, I ought to
say, his blasphemous doctrine of Reprobation.&nbsp; He was
constantly denouncing every one (and against myself he was
peculiarly severe) as lost, whose belief on this point was not,
even in phraseology, the same as his own;&mdash;calling on God to
execute vengeance upon them;&mdash;then blaspheming God, that his
prayers and commands were neither heard nor
obeyed;&mdash;taunting and cursing Him with a contempt which no
language can describe;&mdash;calling his clemency weakness, and
his not executing his decrees a proof he did not possess the
power he pretended to have.&nbsp; In fact no one could hear and
see him without feeling shocked, and without having a conviction
forced upon him that there must be something wrong&mdash;some
perversion of truth in those doctrines, as well as in his own
mental system, out of which all this dreadful spirit, and all
these terrific extremes originated, and of which this case
appeared a Satanic caricature.&nbsp; <a name="page2_9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>It is a truth, that there is no error
or perversion of truth that we may not perceive in reviewing the
history of mind caricatured, and perhaps in a still more striking
manner among those who are in confinement from being
<i>directly</i> denounced insane.</p>
<p>On the subsidence of his excitement, he was overwhelmed with
the perfect recollection of all he had uttered during the utmost
fury of his dreadful ravings, and his state was truly miserable
and deplorable.&nbsp; In this state I took great pains with him,
treated him with every possible kindness, and endeavoured to show
him every possible mark of my confidence: one instance of which
may be mentioned.&mdash;I gave him, at a very early period of his
convalescence, a set of manuscript sermons, all in loose slips,
and which he read with great pleasure, and preserved with great
care.&nbsp; They were affectionate moral discourses, strictly, I
believe, in agreement with the spirit of Christianity, though not
on any peculiar doctrines; for in these I had purposely avoided
all doctrinal points, although doctrinal views may, when properly
presented, be the best preventives, and in some cases the best
medicines, in the cure of insanity; but the circumstances in
which I was at that time placed, appeared to forbid even their
most cautious introduction, and were scarcely admissible to an
audience consisting of some of almost all denominations.&nbsp; <a
name="page2_10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>However, he
said, the spirit of these discourses just suited his altered
state of mind, for he himself felt horror-struck at the views
which had led to such awful consequences.</p>
<p>Though no one can feel more than I do, the necessity of not
busily trying to proselyte or unhinge unnecessarily any
one&rsquo;s settled opinions, yet this was an extreme case, and
in such cases, where cure seems to depend on the proper
administration of counteractive views, every other feeling should
give way to this conviction; but at the same time, every thing
depends on the judicious mode of stating these sounder
views.&nbsp; This case was a remarkable instance of the necessity
of such management; and where such views were apparently of the
utmost importance to his comfort and peace.&nbsp; But it would
require a separate Essay to defend what I conceive those sounder
views; and even were I to give this striking case as a specimen
of their happy influence, I still might lay myself open to cavils
and objections.&nbsp; I shall, therefore, in a separate Essay,
bring forth all the arguments, and exert all the power I possess
in their defence.</p>
<p>Though his furious state was so unusually violent, yet it was
of long duration, and after it had left him, it was some time
before he was able to overcome the painful reflections which came
over him; he however recovered, and returned <a
name="page2_11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>home in the
September following, since which period I have received many, and
almost constant proofs of his great gratitude and attachment to
me, one of which is worthy of being stated.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1824, he walked about a hundred miles to see
me, and not finding my place of residence, he called on a medical
acquaintance, to whom his description of my kindness and
attention, and their happy influence upon himself, were so
powerful and eloquent, that this new and accidental medical
acquaintance, became from that time to the present, my first and
warmest medical friend in encouraging me to establish myself in
my present residence, and to whom I have to attribute the origin
of all my success; so that this recovered patient&rsquo;s
gratitude, who followed me unexpectedly, was the first step in my
progress, and was the <i>sole</i> foundation of every thing which
I have done or exists in this place.&nbsp; It was my only
introduction.&nbsp; I may be permitted, therefore, to acknowledge
my great obligations to the warm-heart friendship of the person,
of whose melancholy state I have just given a general
description, as well as, the medical friend to whom I have
alluded.</p>
<h3><a name="page2_12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span><i>No.</i> 195, <i>admitted October</i> 27<i>th</i>,
1821.</h3>
<p>This case, I shall hereafter show, was apparently saved by
this separation from former associates, at this critical period
of convalescence, and he was one who required very superior and
intellectual attention.</p>
<p>He was a young man of some talents, and of various pursuits
and acquirements, by far too many to be perfect in any one.&nbsp;
Born with a large proportion of the family failing, his vanity
had been fed by flattery and example, so much so, that it might
be said he was bred in vanity&rsquo;s hot-house; and ultimately,
from over excitation, and too little collision with the world, he
fancied himself a second Crichton.&nbsp; Of course with such an
estimate of himself, it could not be otherwise but that he was
constantly meeting with disappointments and mortifications, on
his entrance into his profession, and the real business of
life.&nbsp; From these causes, as well as from an increase at
this time, of parental embarrassments and mortifications, (and
home had always been an atmosphere of perpetual storms), from an
hereditary scrofulous habit, and from his self-made morbid state,
his mind was at last overwhelmed.&nbsp; But it is not my
intention to enter into all the details of his history, further
than to prove that the causes which produced his disease, and the
form <a name="page2_13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>his
insanity assumed, perfectly corresponded with each other.</p>
<p>On his arrival he was in a very exalted state of
over-excitation; he was the greatest of men in every mental
capacity and acquirement; all Philosophers, Poets, Painters, and
Linguists, that had been, or were in existence, were nothing in
comparison with himself, nor were their works to be compared with
those he intended to execute, and the basis of which he had
already formed in his own conception.&nbsp; Nothing could exceed
the vain and pompous displays of his talents and acquirements;
and it is impossible to conceive, from the difficulty he had to
support his pretensions, with the defects under which he then
laboured, what a very painful and ridiculous exhibition it
produced.&nbsp; Still his vanity and exaggerated estimate of
himself, combined with his ineffable contempt for others,
remained unchecked.&nbsp; One feature was very striking; he
possessed considerable powers of imitation, in the exercise of
which he took great delight, and in pouring forth his contempt
against others, he did it with the attitude and voice of Kemble;
it was almost impossible not to feel the force of his manner, and
against myself he was particularly severe, and his poignant
expressions of contempt and indignity were most provoking and
overwhelming.&nbsp; When, however, a change of state occurred, I
felt so interested for his trembling <a name="page2_14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and doubtful situation, that I had
even a bed put up for him in my own room.&nbsp; I had always some
case of this kind about me, and no one can conceive the sacrifice
of health and comfort it cost me.</p>
<p>This case, as well as the last described, may perhaps be
detailed more particularly in their proper place, to illustrate a
general principle, of far more importance than even moral
treatment.&nbsp; And even in moral treatment it will appear how
important this general principle is, to enable us to perceive how
we may best counteract the effects which may have arisen from the
operation of baneful causes: for by it we shall be able to trace
errors to their source, and without this, we can never counteract
and cure them.&nbsp; And this we can only do with certainty, by
possessing correct views of the origin, nature, and constitution
of the human mind, and of the correspondence which exists between
physical effects, and mental or spiritual causes: out of which
views this general principle will be educed, and it will be found
to be of universal application.</p>
<p>In this case it is evident, a system of moral and intellectual
treatment was required, in order to counteract and cure the
effects which had arisen out of the soil in which he had existed,
very different from that which was necessary for the previous
case; and it is equally evident, <a name="page2_15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>without such knowledge, it is more
than probable that neither of these minds would ever have been
restored to their balance, or right state.</p>
<p>He recovered, and his character appeared much improved by his
severe visitation.&nbsp; He became very much attached to me, and
wrote a great deal for me, as my amanuensis.&nbsp; It is worthy
of remark, that he remained of choice for a considerable time
after his health was re-established, on account of the dread he
felt at returning to the place and circumstances where his
disease had arisen.</p>
<p>It is remarkable also, that after he had been some weeks in
private lodgings, assisting his father, in his profession at the
Assizes, he, the very night previous to their intended return
home, made his escape to America.</p>
<p>It is singular, that the first case I had, as an insane
patient, after I left York, was his sister.</p>
<p>I might select a great number of cases, where I conceive such
attention was apparently one principal cause of their recovery,
and which I took under my more immediate care on this account,
and to whom I devoted much of my time, and made many sacrifices
of my comfort and convenience.</p>
<p>In order to show the importance of such attention, it will be
necessary briefly to explain the description and character of the
cases to which I more particularly allude, and that it may <a
name="page2_16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>appear that
these opinions are not new, I shall quote from the first part of
this volume already published.&nbsp; I there say, &ldquo;What is
called mania and melancholia, are for the most part effects of
the same power being overactive, but overactive in different
directions.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the distressing passions are
overactive, we have melancholia,&mdash;if the animal
propensities, we have furious mania,&mdash;and if the
exhilirating passions, we have an exuberance of joyous
activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a view not before taken, and will account for
much of the difference in the effect from the same cause.&nbsp;
This melancholy, or state of depression, caused by the activity
of the depressing passions, is to be distinguished from the state
of exhaustion and debility, which succeeds some violent
paroxysms, or which follows an exhausted state of body and mind
from overexertion, and assumes either an apparent melancholy
character, from torpor or partial suspension of mind, or is in
reality a case of melancholia of the most miserable description,
from the exclusive activity of these depressing passions, which
are then more likely to become the sole masters of the field of
action.&rdquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p>In the former mentioned cases, it appears, that the exciting
and depressing passions alternately <a name="page2_17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>take on habitudes of action, so that
it is still over excitement, but the effects, from its direction
being different, are diametrically opposed to each other: in the
one case, as I have already said, this nervous energy is employed
in exciting into activity the passions which exhilirate: in the
other, those which depress us.</p>
<p>This excitement of the depressing and exhilarating passions
alternately, is the most striking characteristic of the
insane.&nbsp; It is true, that both these states or stages of the
disease, if long continued and not well managed, are necessarily
followed by a third state of exhaustion.&nbsp; The systems of
body and mind are wholly worn out by exertion, and require rest
to recruit and manifest their renewed power, but changes from one
state to another is only a partial exhaustion; another class of
feelings become active, while the former are suspended, so that
the melancholy and &ldquo;high state&rdquo; are for the most
part, states of mind or changes in the direction of its energies,
and not that the melancholy have less than the furiously
malignant or joyous maniac, of that power which is equally
necessary to mental activity of every description.</p>
<p>For instance, I have known the same person sent at one time as
patient under the influence of religious melancholy, originating
in erroneous extreme Calvinistic views; and at another <a
name="page2_18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>period in
the most joyous state of religious excitement, from having come
under the influence of extreme Arminian views.&nbsp; On the same
principle, I have by the most laborious process of argumentation
and the statement of what I conceive right views, produced a
counter-impression, given another character and form to the
disease, and in some cases, on this principle, effected a cure.
<a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>As these cases are much more common, and these views of much
more importance than mankind, or even medical men imagine; and as
many who possess a susceptible constitution of mind, similar to
those whose cases I have described, are living in the world in
this fearful and continual state of mental excitation, and of
course, may be on the verge of the same precipice, it is right
they should be warned of the danger to which they expose
themselves.</p>
<p>It need scarcely be mentioned, that the present constitution
of society is not in a healthy state.&nbsp; It is not bound
together by that order and sympathy which should exist, but on
the contrary, discord and disseverment prevail to an extent which
seem to threaten its decomposition and destruction.&nbsp; But too
many individuals are <a name="page2_19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>intoxicated with the fury of their
various passions and inordinate desires, and mad with the endless
anxieties and reverses they produce.&nbsp; One part of society,
as well as one part of the mind, is at war with another.&nbsp; I
wish it, however, to be particularly observed, because I shall
have to revert to the fact hereafter, that it is not so much
these exciting causes, or even the sad effects of these feverish
and wasting passions, that are in themselves so dreadful and
fatal, as they are when accompanied or followed by the conflicts
and condemnations of conscience.&nbsp; Wherever there is the
endeavour to overturn and sacrifice some confirmed and good
principle, that which is lowest is encouraged to struggle for
pre-eminence, and the mind suffers extreme misery and
distraction.</p>
<p>It is in this way that we often find minds that have much that
is amiable about them, are soonest overthrown; but in all cases
when (as in this and what is in fatality next to this, perpetual
domestic discord) <i>the fire of our spirits</i>, which should
give life, health, and support to our exertions, is not united
and clothed with that wisdom which ought to diffuse itself in
every useful direction; it is in an altered and dangerous state,
producing, according to this alteration of state, disordered
function, <i>acrid secretions</i>, and if long continued,
disease; and when disease is established, its state is further
altered, so as <a name="page2_20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>literally to &ldquo;eat up the flesh,&rdquo; and in one
form or another burns, scathes, withers, and consumes us, <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a> but I need not now enter into all the
various evils, miseries, and conflicts in which the mind is
involved, and the dangers to which it is exposed, nor the
corresponding physical effects, nor show that even were these
extremes exclusive and improper, activity does not exist, but
where the understanding seems most completely called forth; still
we have reason to fear that we pursue the important duties of
civil life, whether it be the weighty matters of legislation, or
the scarcely less responsible exercise of the learned
professions, or what ought to be the binding and sweet influence
of faithful dealings in trade, and our common intercourse with
each other, in an improper spirit, and from improper motives, and
not with that singleness and simplicity of heart for each
other&rsquo;s good, which alone is useful and safe; which we
could not fail to do, were we sufficiently aware, that in as far
as we depart from this purity of spirit, our views of truth must
be perverted, <i>and our </i><a name="page2_21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span><i>healthy vital energies
changed</i>, <i>causing fever</i>, <i>paralysis</i>, <i>or some
morbid state</i>, and all our sympathies poisoned and
deranged.&nbsp; But I might find enough of matter for
illustration without detailing the effects of over-excitation,
arising from our mad desires after wealth, fame, and distinction,
or even the consequent distracting and overwhelming miseries of
misfortune, poverty, and starvation, in the modes and amusements
of fashionable life, to which sensitive persons, and especially
those who have made themselves morbidly sensitive, become, as in
the case last stated, the victims.</p>
<p>Excitable and cheerful persons often fall into states of
depression, purely because they have drawn too largely and
exclusively on their exhilirating passions; whereas, had they
drawn equally on the depressing passions, they would have
tempered and balanced each other, and kept the mind in its right
state; and such is the constitution of the world we live in, that
our duties require that both should have their relative and
appropriate share of exercise.</p>
<p>Persons, often, in company, think it necessary exclusively to
exercise the exhilirating passions, and they return home not only
with these feelings exhausted, but with the depression passions
assuming in their turn an over-active state, and in this state
they perhaps encourage a spirit of discontent, and peevishness,
making sad havoc <a name="page2_22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>of domestic peace, and producing an unhealthy state of
mind, <i>an alteration in the state of the nervous energy</i>,
<i>generating an acrid and morbific matter in the system</i>,
<i>and ultimately disease</i>, both in themselves and others. <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p>It is too well known that many who are all life and energy in
company, sink on returning home, into this state of apathetic
melancholy.&nbsp; This is especially the case with those persons
who are betrayed by their buoyant spirits and powers of pleasing
into extremes, exciting themselves by stimulus and other
excesses; and as they are often minds originally of the most
amiable constitution, they afterwards, when left to sober
reflection, are overwhelmed with self-condemnation; and should
they, to raise their sinking spirits, have again recourse to
stimulus, the evil is increased, and the effects are
terrific.&nbsp; It is to these painful and conscientious
conflicts, as much, and perhaps more, than the mere physical
effect of their excess, that the disorder and destruction of
their minds are to be attributed.</p>
<p>I mention these simple and common forms of irregular and
discordant excitation, to shew that from such causes the
susceptible mind gets <a name="page2_23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>into the habit which may terminate in
the more fixed and serious form of alternate states of
irresistible excitement of the exhilirating and depressing
passions, constituting insane cases, just as we find those of the
alternate over-excitement of the kindly and benevolent
affections; or, of the angry and malevolent passions terminate in
corresponding states.</p>
<p>How many persons live in this baneful domestic atmosphere of
perpetual storm and sunshine?&nbsp; And hence, when the mind of
one of these becomes morbid, and the malevolent passions assume
the exclusive sway, they are said to hate those they formerly
loved, which is simply the more permanent state of their former
fits of anger; in fact, every form of incipient insanity may be
traced with more or less ease, to these corresponding
causes.&nbsp; This may not be popular doctrine, but it is the
truth.</p>
<p>Many married persons get into this destructive habit of
indulging in these extremes of anger and affection; and where
they are known to have existed in no common measure, they
propagate this their state of mind in their children, and which
is afterwards most effectually and successfully educated by their
conduct and example; and hence such domestic circles are fruitful
soils in producing insane cases.&nbsp; I could state some fearful
examples of the truth of these observations, but I would gladly
throw <a name="page2_24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>a
veil over these melancholy pictures of human nature.&nbsp; The
sword may slay its thousands, but the demon of domestic strife is
much more destructive to man&rsquo;s life, health, and peace.</p>
<p>I mention all these matters, to show that such are exactly, in
their incipient form, the cases which require the most delicate,
intellectual, and laborious attention.&nbsp; The delusions which
occur in an after stage, arise out of these habits, and until
they appear without disguise, it is difficult for strangers to
pronounce them insane; and yet these are causes which produce the
worst and most incurable consequences; and if cure is to be
effected, it can only be by a system of management, which by
calming and tranquillising the mind, will best allow the physical
effects to subside.&nbsp; But when this painful and irritable
state of mind has been of long duration, and some chronic and
inflammatory state of insiduous, slow, and gradual growth, is the
consequence; then a longer time will be required before cure can
be brought about.&nbsp; I may here remark, that it is absurd to
suppose we can expect this, by moral or medical means
singly,&mdash;they must always co-operate, and never be separated
in the mind of him whose object is cure: and it is a most
important and fearful consideration, that on their treatment
depends the increase or diminution of their disease.</p>
<p>To show there is the greatest difficulty, delicacy, <a
name="page2_25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and anxiety
required to be exercised in the management of these cases, it is
only necessary to mention, that they are precisely those, who, as
I have already said, though they are either in reality, or
ultimately prove the worst and most dangerous cases, can
nevertheless, in the incipient stage of the disease, and more
especially immediately after being placed under moral restraint
and medical care, exert their remaining power of self-control
over their delusions and extravagances, so as to appear, for some
considerable time, perfectly sane.&nbsp; Indeed, it may be
considered as a general fact, that where the insane person
preserves his individuality of character, and his alarming state
is chiefly indicated by his having his prominent peculiarities in
the natural constitution of his mind in a highly exaggerated and
caricatured state, (which is always a most unfavourable
prognostic, and more particularly if this exaggeration be
grounded in self-love,) the incipient stage assumes this delusive
appearance.</p>
<p>It is to such cases, in their incipient stage, that I have
hitherto devoted myself, and which I have had for the last
fourteen years constantly about me.</p>
<p>In devoting ourselves to such cases, we are doing no more than
we conceive to be our duty, nor do I conceive this explanation
makes, in all cases, our own house superior to others.&nbsp; In
<a name="page2_26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>some
cases, the reverse is the fact.&nbsp; This explanation is
intended to show the necessity of classification, and division of
labour.&nbsp; In many cases, so far from giving a preference to
ourselves, I would give a preference to the surgeon, matron, and
attendants at the other houses.&nbsp; In many cases, they become
attached to them, and prefer remaining with them.&nbsp; Besides,
a mere change is sometimes useful, and often operates as a
powerful check;&mdash;they are in their favourite
house,&mdash;they behave ill, and a threat of removal restrains
them.&nbsp; All this requires attention, and is assisted by the
arrangements described.</p>
<p>To show this is no new and fallacious view, manufactured and
brought forward for the mere purpose of my own defence, I beg
leave to quote from an explanation of the drawings and plans of
the houses and grounds, which were, according to the Act of
Parliament, sent to the Quarter Sessions at Chelmsford, now many
years ago.&mdash;Speaking of Leopard&rsquo;s Hill establishment,
I said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At present there are no very violent cases,
and some that were so are convalescent, and when patients become
convalescent, they are often removed to my own house at Fair
Mead, in order to relieve them from painful associations; by
contributing in every way to their comfort and their happiness,
and by devoting ourselves more particularly <a
name="page2_27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>to them, we
secure and expedite their cure; this removal is often most
expedient and useful, but it sometimes happens, <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> that they prefer remaining amongst
those to whom they have become attached; and they are then
removed out of the galleries, and have apartments in the front
and family part of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair Mead House, I wish it to be distinctly understood,
is an additional house in the same grounds, but at a sufficient
distance to serve the purpose I have just stated,&mdash;the
purpose of humane classification, according to their state.&nbsp;
In fact, agreeable to these views, it may be considered as a
necessary appendage to the others.&nbsp; It enables us the better
to discharge a most important and delicate duty, that of more
closely watching, and more directly and personally attending to
patients during the incipient and critical stage of
convalescence; a period when, wanting such attention, they are
driven by a revulsion of feeling into their old state, or sink
from exhaustion, and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, by having three houses separated in this way,
and for these purposes, it not only enables us to divide the
males from the females, but also to devote ourselves to those to
whom a <a name="page2_28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>more delicate and intellectual attention may be useful,
in this critical period of convalescence, and it also enables us
to select such, whether old or recent cases, as are capable of
participating in, and not deranging very much the enjoyments of
the domestic and social circle.&nbsp; All which will include
convalescents; some incipient cases; some that are melancholy;
others that are imbecile; some that may be permanently deranged,
but very full of good nature, and not troublesome; and some that
are hopeless upon some specific point, but pretty correct on all
others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another consideration of greater moment is, that persons
necessarily attach an importance to the house in which we more
generally reside, and even some recent slight cases feel none of
that painful repugnance in coming to us, that is usually felt on
the bare mention of a place of confinement, <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a> and many come not only without
reluctance, but with voluntary pleasure.&nbsp; In my tables, sent
to Lord Lyndhurst three years ago, I there show that more than
one-third of the patients then received, had been so brought, and
&ldquo;that I had always held forth to them the promise that they
were coming as visitors,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;as long as you
behave as such, you shall be treated as such.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page2_29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>When they
forfeit this, they are deprived of their privileges, and, in some
cases, they may be sent to Leopard&rsquo;s Hill establishment;
and in others, a threat of their being removed from this to Fair
Mead, answers the same purpose.</p>
<p>I consider it a point of the very first importance, that truth
should never be violated; we must, therefore, on no account, at
any time, deceive them, and more especially in the first
instance.&nbsp; If we begin by destroying confidence, we destroy
the basis on which alone all moral good can be effected.&nbsp;
Without truth there can be no confidence.&nbsp; It is quite a
mistake to suppose a system of deceit is necessary for the
purpose of more quietly accomplishing their removal from
home.&nbsp; I can conscientiously assert that my own experience
proves the contrary, and that I have not found in a tithe of the
cases which I have had to manage, any very great difficulty in
persuading them willingly to accompany me, more especially if I
had sufficient time given me to ingratiate myself into their good
opinion and confidence, which I do, by fully explaining the
object of their removal, the treatment I intend to adopt, and the
means to be used to make them as happy as possible in the new
circumstances in which they are about to be placed.&nbsp;
Whenever this was done, and I found them in a state to understand
it, which is the case in a greater number <a
name="page2_30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of
instances than most persons imagine, they have then almost
invariably been persuaded to come willingly, without using any
arts of deception.</p>
<p>I delicately, but candidly tell them, that they are considered
to be insane, that the disease has produced some change in their
usual mode of feeling and thinking, that the object of the
proposed visit is their good, and that if they will only go
willingly along with me, I pledge myself they shall be treated as
visitors, unless their own conduct should oblige me to act
otherwise towards them.&nbsp; If after all the pains I take, (and
no pains can be too great to accomplish my object in this
faithful way,) they still refuse, I then tell them, that their
going is a matter quite settled, and cannot possibly be altered;
that they may as well make a merit of necessity, and like
rational beings, go at once with cheerfulness, and good-will, in
order that they may still receive the good which I have promised
them.</p>
<p>If after such explanations they do consent to go willingly, or
even without much force, a grand point is accomplished; for in
this case, suppose after their arrival they grossly commit
themselves, and justly forfeit their claim to the treatment I
have promised them, and I am obliged to abridge them of the
liberty they had really given them, they then feel and often
acknowledge <a name="page2_31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>the justice of any change in their treatment, which is
the result of their gross misconduct, and they exert themselves
with the hope of regaining the liberal privileges they have
forfeited, and thus from their desire to be considered and
treated as visitors, they put forth into operation what is of the
greatest importance, the valuable principle of self-control.</p>
<p>In most cases, while nothing is more consoling to their
afflicted spirits than friendship, and the society of those they
love, nothing is more grievous to them than its loss.&nbsp; To
form such a feeling, is very difficult; but by beginning and
proceeding on these principles, showing them that truth and
justice and kindness are the basis of our actions, we establish a
wonderful moral influence over them.</p>
<p>It will often happen, however, in stating to them that their
minds are not considered in a right state, they will stoutly deny
it.&nbsp; I then assure them, I shall be very glad to find they
are right, and hope they will not force upon me by their conduct,
a different conviction.&nbsp; Stating to them very gravely, what
I understand has led to this conclusion, saying, if we judge by
the acknowledged rules of the world, they must confess there is
something very unusual and strange in their words and actions;
but at the same time, I trust they will not in future commit or
lose themselves, as it appears <a name="page2_32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>they must have done.&nbsp; In which
case I promise them I will myself befriend them, and endeavour to
replace them as soon as possible, in the confidence of their
friends, but which I can only do when their conduct will enable
me to transfer to their friends the confidence it has given
me.&nbsp; Many, of course, assert, that what others call
insanity, they know to be correct and proper; then I say, we must
have time to examine it at leisure, that it is too weighty a
matter to determine in haste.&nbsp; Where the person cannot be
made to comprehend all this reasoning, of course other methods
must be adopted, according to the nature, exigencies, and the
state of each patient.&nbsp; In fact, it is impossible to state
all that is, or ought to be done on these occasions; we can only
hint at the spirit of the procedure, for every separate case
requires its own appropriate plan of procedure.</p>
<p>To show the propriety and advantages in this method of
proceeding, I shall state the important fact, that some few have
at once been cured, without removal from home, by the powerful
influence of its candour and honesty.&mdash;And in all cases,
when, after all this labour and delicacy, they are removed, and
are, subsequently, on the same principles, and in the same
spirit, treated with every possible indulgence, and the greatest
degree of forbearance, even overlooking <a
name="page2_33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>many lesser
faults, and waiting, until, as we say, &ldquo;they break out and
commit themselves,&rdquo; in some very decided manner, so as to
furnish us (even in their own estimation) with a very palpable
plea to abridge them of their indulgencies, they have then forced
upon them the conviction of their error, and are obliged to
acknowledge the justice of any change that is made.</p>
<p>It is singular, that many have on this plan been speedily
cured by the self-restraint this system conspired with other
things to give them; and many others have recovered without ever
feeling or considering themselves as having been treated as
insane patients; and most of them do not consider themselves as
under any confinement whatever.&nbsp; Not more than about 3 p.
cent. suffer any personal restraint, and not one for years under
any constant personal coercion, and we have, at times, been for
months together with not more than one patient whom we were
afraid of trusting in the grounds alone.</p>
<p>I must more particularly advert to this most powerful argument
in favour of this plan, which is, that it conduces to form the
habit of self-control, which <i>is the habit above all others</i>
which ought ever be our aim to form.&nbsp; It ought to be the
primary object in every moral plan of cure.&nbsp; But I shall
have some further observations to make on this principle, and the
various means which tend to form and increase it, in another
place.&nbsp; <a name="page2_34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>I only hint at these things at this time, for the
purpose of showing that all these delicate, modified,
conditional, and encouraging plans of superintendance are
assisted by the arrangements I have described.</p>
<p>In fact, so important have I considered this plan of
Classification, that when I first came to Leopard&rsquo;s Hill
Lodge, I contrived the best way I could, with my means, to have a
family and front part of the house, independent of the galleries;
and should I be called upon to extend my plan to meet my
increasing success, and should my life be spared, and time and
health permit me to follow out my views and to build an Asylum
upon a larger scale, I should keep these principles of
Classification, as well as many others, in view, in the plan I
should adopt, for I am more and more confirmed that they are
extremely important; and I may mention as proofs, that at all the
houses we have had parties in the front part, who would, in their
conduct and pursuits, and social enjoyments, put to shame many
families who are reckoned perfectly sane.&nbsp; We have visiting
parties from house to house, with the usual amusements of cards,
chess, billiards, cricket, &amp;c.&nbsp; For some months we
published a weekly newspaper of considerable interest.&nbsp; Nor
is it unworthy of notice, that some articles of a very superior
kind in our critical Journals have been written <a
name="page2_35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>in this
place; all which gives it more an air of social enjoyment and
comfort, than the coldness and repulsiveness usually attendant on
the loss of liberty, and forms within ourselves a little world of
interest, better suited, I believe, to the state of the
inhabitants than the real world could be to them.&nbsp; It is, in
fact, a System of Classification, originating, if not in the most
enlightened, at any rate in the most humane considerations of the
various states and maladies of mental aberration, and which
enables us to exercise a powerful influence over those under our
care.&nbsp; It is in agreement with our conviction of the
importance of that which may be laid down as a maxim, that, if
the mind be maintained in a state of tranquillity, the affections
are more likely to be brought into a right state, the effects of
functional disorder, or even disease, to subside; the mists of
delusion to clear away; and the light of the understanding to
resume its province.</p>
<p>The last and most important consideration is, that this plan
has induced several (especially before the letter and spirit of
the law were opposed thereto) to return voluntarily on their
perceiving symptoms of their returning malady.</p>
<p>I could give, were it not that motives of delicacy forbid me,
some very striking and interesting cases, illustrative of these
facts and these principles, and the beneficial results which
arise out of them.</p>
<p><a name="page2_36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>One
of these cases, illustrative of this necessity of more delicate
and intellectual treatment in certain states of mental
aberration, I am advocating, I may mention.&nbsp; It is that of a
lady who had been, upwards of seventeen years, in alternate
states of excitement and depression, and in confinement all this
time, whose recovery I attribute, combined with medical means,
principally to such attention.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 335 <i>was first admitted of her own accord</i>,
<i>March</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1826, <i>aged</i> 56; <i>discharged May
the</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1826; <i>again returned of her own
accord</i>, <i>June</i> 30<i>th</i>, 1826 <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></h3>
<p>This case was a most striking sample of a great number of a
similar description, who are the subjects and victims of this
perverse and irregular mental excitation, which become, without
proper management, more confirmed cases of mania and melancholia,
which continuance in this state for a sufficient time, produces
disease, and disorganization of the brain, and ultimately
terminates in incurable dementia, either of a partial or more
general character.</p>
<p><a name="page2_37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>She
was a person of a highly sanguine temperament, possessing by
nature great capabilities, but her intellectual powers had not,
by education or circumstances in life, been so much developed and
increased as her energetic feelings, which were most excitable,
strong, and active.&nbsp; If her education had equalled her
natural endowments, her understanding would have assumed no
common pre-eminence, and in which case her feelings would
probably have been brought under due subordination.&nbsp; It was
not, however, so much even the defects of her education, as the
circumstances of her life, and especially those connected with
her religious associations, which were incomparably more
calculated to increase the strength and activity of her feelings,
than to call forth and cultivate her intellectual powers; indeed,
instead of any such cultivation in any proportionate degree,
there is every reason to believe, these associations had a
paralysing influence; nor perhaps were any habits of
self-control, or any mental restraint whatever, formed or
acquired in this connection, except that which operated too
exclusively on her religious and conscientious fears; and hence,
without entering into the details of her history, the result was
the formation of a character, such as is most common under the
present artificial systems and circumstances in modern times, ill
formed to <a name="page2_38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>withstand the effects of adverse or prosperous
fortune.</p>
<p>It was her lot to pass through these extremes, and after
suffering many reverses, mortifications, disappointments,
bereavements, and some matters of a private and most afflictive
nature, she had a rheumatic fever, when the explosion took place;
then the weak and over-exercised parts of her mind displayed
themselves in an irregular and increased degree.&nbsp; Her state
was an exaggeration of her former energetic and acute nervous
sensibility, operating alternately on the depressing, and
exhilirating passions.</p>
<p>When she came to me, for she had been in various places
previous to this period, she was in a state of religious
melancholia.&nbsp; Her conscientious fears were dreadful, and her
misery extreme.&nbsp; She conceived herself condemned to eternal
punishment&mdash;she was already in torture.&nbsp; When in this
terrible state, she had more power to engage one&rsquo;s
commiseration, than any patient I ever had.&nbsp; Her
descriptions of her own state were extremely eloquent and
affecting, and her appeals for sympathy were overpowering and
irresistible, and I was absolutely worn out and overcome by the
fatigue and misery I endured in my efforts to console and restore
her.&nbsp; I shall always continue to feel the painful effects of
my anxious exertions in this and several similar cases of
melancholia; but no case and perhaps <a name="page2_39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>no number of cases, shook and
overwhelmed my nervous system as this did, (unless it be one
through whom I had a nervous fever); not merely because of her
extreme agony, but my own health and spirits were then in a very
depressed state, having been for years a martyr to chronic
enteritis and gastritis.&nbsp; I mention this to account for the
obligation I felt myself under, to dissever my sympathies from
this overwhelming influence, and to transfer her to the kind care
of Mrs. Allen, to whose lively and cheerful disposition, uniform
and judicious kindness, combined with great firmness and
gentleness, soothed and softened her melancholy state, and, in
time, tempered the extremes to which she had been subject, and
kept her spirits in a better direction.</p>
<p>One great art in this management was that of Mrs.
Allen&rsquo;s making her useful as her deputy in every thing in
the house, either in matters of a household nature, or in
attending upon others.&nbsp; And notwithstanding her own
miserable state, no one was ever more qualified for a nurse, or
better understood every thing connected with the arrangements of
the table; and her very perfection in all these matters, had,
before Mrs. Allen came, been the cause of an increase rather than
a relief to her misery, for she became the object of great
jealousy and dislike to my housekeepers and matrons, on this
score: but now it <a name="page2_40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>became a source of employment, amusement, and
diversion.&nbsp; Though she long continued to possess, for the
most part, this disposition to fall into the same miserable
state, yet it never afterwards degenerated into that dreadful
agony and distraction I have described.&nbsp; At times it ceased
altogether, and her more happy state supervened, when she was
full of hope and self-esteem, of life and activity, the very
antipodes of her former state.&nbsp; But it is altogether
astonishing how both these states were lessened and kept in check
by Mrs. Allen&rsquo;s manners, combining the most inflexible
firmness with admirable tact and good nature.&nbsp; When all her
almost exhaustless fund of sympathy failed, it was always found a
sufficient check, and at once to call forth our patient&rsquo;s
powers of self-control, for Mrs. Allen to say that she really
could not bear the association of her miserable state any longer,
and that they must separate; and it was very seldom necessary to
hold out the threat, that she must be removed into the gallery
and back part of the house.</p>
<p>Perseverance in this system of unwearied and perhaps
unequalled kindness, gradually mitigated and diminished these
alternate states of excitement and depression; thus shewing to
demonstration, that in this way, with the aid of medical
treatment, the excitement of the depressing and the exhilirating
passions may <a name="page2_41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>be checked and restrained, so that in time they may
regain their due equilibrium;&mdash;that instead of these cases
degenerating, as they have almost always done, into hopeless
cases of mania or melancholia, and often terminating in complete
dementia, they, by this system, might in process of time regain
the due equipoise, or the relative and appropriate share of the
exercise of the different functions of mind, and be brought, as
in the case just described, to repossess the greatest of
blessings, the healthy action of the feelings and faculties in
the discharge of those duties which constitute alike the object,
the usefulness, and the happiness of her present existence.</p>
<p>I mention such cases, because I shall hereafter do all I can
to draw attention to similar mental states, as the common causes
of insanity.&nbsp; That almost all cases <i>begin in this
way</i>, but that they are disguised or kept from our view, with
those who possess self control, until (unless the tendency be
cured by such efforts to disguise it) they at last burst forth
into some form of insanity; and indeed insanity itself may be
defined generally, the uncontrolled over-excitement, imbecility,
suspended or paralysed state of one or more of the mental
functions, arising from some previous faulty state of
action.&nbsp; I shall have to show hereafter how all these cases
might in their incipient and curable stage have <a
name="page2_42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>their
specific modes of moral and medical treatment applied in order to
counteract and cure them; and by this method incurable cases
would be almost unknown.</p>
<p>At the same time let it be observed, that such treatment
requires much more delicate and intellectual attention than is in
the power of those who for the most part live amongst the insane,
and, have the direct and important management of them; and that,
in justice to ourselves, I have a right to assert, that where
such treatment has existed, and does exist, it is not a matter
which money can remunerate, and that in this case there was no
pecuniary reward.&nbsp; It was no such inducement that had any
influence in regulating the conduct which we pursued with such
unwearied diligence; and not merely was there no pecuniary
reward, but even gratitude was wanting for a time; for this
attention was so delicate, that she was always made to feel she
was the person conferring rather than receiving favours; so that
when she was relieved from her depressed state, and it was
superseded by the excitement of the exhilirating passions, her
self esteem dwelt only on the favours she imagined she had been
conferring.&nbsp; <i>She was useful</i>, but her usefulness was
more for her own good than for ours.&nbsp; Indeed, we paid the
price of patient endurance to a degree and extent which can never
be conceived <a name="page2_43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>or known, still less was she in a state to perceive or
appreciate our motives, therefore she conceived, and was
confirmed in the impression that she was actually the person to
whom obligation and gratitude were due.&nbsp; This impression was
the last remains of her disease, or of that over-excitement of
the exhilirating passions, which with the longer-continued
paroxysms of the over-excitement of the depressing passions,
constituted the character of her case; and she left us, not
merely before the &ldquo;high state&rdquo; had solely subsided,
but at the very time when we felt it to be our duty to restrain
and subdue it, and of course when she felt most mortified, and
was least able to perceive and appreciate our motives, but which
she has since done to our entire satisfaction.</p>
<p>She has now been upwards of three years in the world, engaged
in useful and active duties, and though she may be liable to
extremes, and be too susceptible of the action of exciting
causes, yet I have every reason to believe, that experience has
taught her the necessity of counteracting and restraining their
baneful influence.&nbsp; I am told by her friends, that now
collision with the world having smoothed down the peculiarities
which her long seclusion had contracted, her character appears
much improved.</p>
<p>I might detail many such cases, and prove <a
name="page2_44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>that cures
have apparently been effected by this intellectual and delicate
attention, and more especially in some slight and incipient
cases.&nbsp; But I may also state, that many cases of the most
serious kind have been so treated, and have recovered.&nbsp; I
particularly have in view, two cases of the most determined
suicidal melancholy, that were so delicately treated and watched,
that they were not themselves aware for months, they were even in
a place of confinement, or they had an eye of anxiety constantly
watching over them.&nbsp; To this watchfulness and constant
exertion to amuse and divert them, I principally attribute the
gradual diminution of their melancholy, and ultimately their
recovery.&nbsp; These cases, No. 412, and 373, have each returned
three or four times of their own accord, and have each time,
under this system, gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Is it not then of importance that we should do every thing
possible to lessen the present feelings of horror associated with
such places? then might we expect to find them come of their own
accord, have confidence in their medical friend, concur and
co-operate in the plan marked out for their cure, and the
consequence would be, that we should find them generally
recover.</p>
<h3><a name="page2_45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span><i>No.</i> 373 <i>came of his own choice</i>,</h3>
<p>And was a most distressing case of hypochondria, which had
from various causes been increasing upon him for about twenty
years; and when he so came, he was in the most depressed and
melancholy state possible.&nbsp; His whole mucous membrane had
long suffered from chronic inflammation, and was in a state of
the greatest irritability.&nbsp; He was, in less than nine
months, altogether another being; his habits were altered, and
his health greatly re-established; and this person was one whose
cure was partly to be attributed to my mode of amusing him.&nbsp;
I do not mean to enter into his particular history, or his
medical treatment, for it would itself make a volume; but I
introduce a brief notice of his cure, for the sake of
illustrating the foregoing principles of Classification, and to
show that a variety of methods are necessary to accomplish the
object we ought ever to have in view, and that it would never
answer to apply indiscriminately the same medical or moral
treatment to any two cases.</p>
<p>A plan was proposed to spend an hour at least with him every
evening, and this hour I devoted to that of detailing to him a
history of my own life, always contriving, in the style of the
Arabian Nights Entertainments, to break off suddenly at some
point of interest; and these <a name="page2_46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>conversations, had they been
committed to writing, would have formed some very amusing
volumes.&nbsp; The great art and merit of the plan consisted not
merely in making them amusing, but in contriving to introduce,
without appearing intentionally to do so, (that I might not in
his over sensitive state offend him), facts and views calculated
to counteract the errors and bad habits into which he had
fallen.</p>
<p>In all cases it is necessary to know every extreme view and
error to which the human mind is liable, and where these exist,
as inmost cases of insanity, to endeavour to counteract them by
clear and beautiful views of the truth.</p>
<p>What is of the greatest consequence, is that it is still more
necessary to know the best mode of making truth admissible and
effectual; for it ought never to be forgotten, that in all cases
where error and delusion exist, even if we know those views which
are best calculated to counteract and remove them, still more
depends on the manner, circumstances, and spirit in which we
present and apply them.&nbsp; I am anxious to draw attention to
this truth, because it appears to me the world at present has no
adequate conception of this great and necessary art in its
propagation: still less does it appear that mankind, nor even
many medical men, have formed any proper estimate of the vast
importance of such a system in the treatment of the insane: a
system, however, which requires <a name="page2_47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>that we should be fully acquainted
with the history of man, and be able to perceive the causes and
effects of false and perverted views of philosophy, morals, and
religion, and above all that we should possess a knowledge of the
constitution of the human mind, with all the specific differences
of every individual case.</p>
<p>I mention this case with others, to show that there are many
instances where something more than common attention is required,
and that to such patients we devote ourselves, and have them at
our own house for this purpose.&nbsp; These are precisely those
who are over excitable.&nbsp; They form a large proportion of the
insane, and in their incipient stage, their minds are rather in a
state of perversion, than absolutely lost or deranged; whose cure
depends on correcting this perversion, and restoring the relative
and appropriate share of activity and energy to each function, in
the exact measure, proper place, and according to the order of
their right distribution.</p>
<p>If then, these houses serve these various purposes, who is
best able to judge when such purposes can be best served?&nbsp;
The exact moment lost can never be regained! a wrong word, or
even look, may unhinge, and bring on a relapse!&nbsp; It is a
species of discipline like that of a nursery;&mdash;children
commit some fault, and are removed from the objects of their
affection as their punishment; and no punishment is <a
name="page2_48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>greater or
more effectual.&nbsp; Some of our circle break out into passion,
or give way to some strong propensity; they are told it
won&rsquo;t do, and are removed: they soon promise to behave
better, and return.&nbsp; The causes are sudden and unexpected,
and sometimes trivial; and this mild medicine, instantly
administered, has a wonderful influence.&nbsp; Sometimes the
attendants will be better suited for some specific cases at one
house than at the other; and it may be injustice to other
patients to change them, but great justice to change the patient
on their account.</p>
<p>When I state to patients&rsquo; friends these matters, and the
difference of these houses, I say decidedly, that in those cases
to whom our attention, and the comforts of the domestic circle
may be useful,&mdash;those friends should, if they possess the
means, prove, by a corresponding remuneration, that they duly
estimate such delicate attention; particularly as they do
generally acknowledge that it is not in the power of money to
compensate for the expenditure of so much feeling, and being
subjected to so much annoyance.&nbsp; In all cases where it
appears this attention and placing them in our domestic circle,
will contribute to their comfort or their cure, we, as a matter
of feeling and of duty, treat them with equal kindness and
attention, always giving considerations of comfort and of cure,
the first place.</p>
<p><a name="page2_49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Besides, most cases are improved by association with
those of a different character.&nbsp; I have seen many old torpid
cases, and a still greater number of recent cases of suspension
of mind, cured by being placed occasionally among those who were
in a more lively state, and this after every other means had
failed.&mdash;And it is reasonable, for nothing can exceed the
comic effect of the strange and laughable speeches and manners of
some among this class of patients; and, in the case, the
treatment of which was altogether mistaken or mis-represented,
there was surely nothing incredible or unreasonable in saying I
preferred, that this lady should have the chance of being roused
out of her torpid state, by remaining at Leopard&rsquo;s Hill
Lodge, where of course, she might have these means occasionally
put in force; for all the females were then at that house, and at
the same time, she did possess the advantage of every possible
delicacy of attention from Mrs. Allen, who was, with her children
and an additional number of servants, then living altogether at
that house.</p>
<p>The case No. 335, was, as I have already mentioned, always
soonest roused out of her melancholy condition, by being placed
for a short time in the midst of such association.&nbsp; It would
be contrary to the economy of providence, as exemplified by the
constitution of <a name="page2_50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>society, to place all the melancholy in one class, and
all the lively in another.&nbsp; The truth of this argument
receives additional confirmation, when we consider, which I am
prepared to prove, that insanity in many cases, is produced by,
and consists of, an aggravation of the original peculiarity of
character, and therefore it is evident, that such collision, like
collision in the world, is making one extreme tend to correct
another, though of course, the worst and most dangerous cases of
every description, are not in their treatment included in this
principle.</p>
<p>Many instances are recorded, of two opposite cases, by being
thrown together, neutralizing, like an acid and alkali, each
other; that is, the melancholy have been roused by the lively,
and the lively depressed by the melancholy, and thus both have
been brought into a better state.</p>
<p>Sometimes the insane have been cured by witnessing their own
case caricatured in that of another.&nbsp; For instance, two
proud men, the victims of their gradual and progressive false
estimate of themselves, assume in their insane state, the same
crown and kingdom, and by witnessing each other&rsquo;s delusion,
have been forced to feel that one must be in the wrong; and thus,
one or both were brought to reflection, and ultimately to a more
sound and sober state of mind.</p>
<p>Even the imbecile and idiot, are roused and <a
name="page2_51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>improved by
such associations, more than they had been, even with every
endeavour to improve them, while they were in a state of
seclusion.&nbsp; I have lately had two very remarkable instances
of this kind.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 425 <i>and</i> 429.</h3>
<p>Imbeciles, though they were from birth, they improved after
their arrival; the scene was very different to the solitude in
which they had been placed; the common scenes and circumstances
of life, had not had sufficient power to rouse the dormant and
torpid state of their mental functions, while scenes and
circumstances, that are in themselves very painful, were better
calculated to arouse in their moping minds, something like feeble
efforts of reflection.&nbsp; I have seen them behold the strange
antics of others, with intense wonder and interest.&mdash;Often
they will catch the contagion of laughter; and thus if the
understanding has no part in the matter, their spirits, at all
events, partake of the merriment of the scene around them; and
though insanity, considered in the abstract, is a melancholy
thing, yet it is a truth, that there is much more of merriment
than melancholy among the insane.&nbsp; I believe their average
of happiness is greater than would be found among the same number
in the world.&nbsp; Those who look with prejudice from
impressions received <a name="page2_52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>from a few extreme cases, of course
make out a different conclusion.&nbsp; Again, there is another
consideration, which further proves that the happiness of these
imbeciles and ideots may be increased by such association.&nbsp;
They have still the blind affections craving for food, and they
here find food for their gratification, better suited to their
state than they could find it in the world.&nbsp; These
affections without understanding, are to the world
repulsive.&nbsp; It is strength of affection, guided by strength
of understanding, that so powerfully attracts and binds society
together.&nbsp; In this sphere they cannot revolve; here,
eccentric as it is, they have one better suited to their
state.</p>
<p>I daily see ideots and imbeciles taught to walk arm in arm;
evidently pleased and gratified that they have objects for their
blind affections to rest upon.&nbsp; Besides this, it is a very
singular and remarkable fact, that this exercise of their
affections, has contributed to the improvement of their physical
state.&nbsp; Whatever increases innocent enjoyment, and
contributes to happiness, are excellent medicines.&nbsp; Peace
and purity of mind are better than physic.&nbsp; This exercise of
their blind affections conduces alike to their felicity, and to
the preservation of their health, by innocently keeping alive the
regular and happy exercise of their animal spirits, by the only
outlet they possess, <a name="page2_53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>that of their blind and instinctive
affections; and hence, it is very remarkable, that in consequence
of their animal spirits being no longer pent up, as was formerly
the case, they are not now so liable to those sudden bursts and
irregular displays of passion, to which they had been the
victims; and what is still more remarkable, they are in better
health, and not so liable to cramps and colics, which had been
the corresponding physical effects of their irregular nervous
distribution; so that even with them the truth is evident, that
it is not good to be alone; the little world they live in is
better suited to amuse and contribute to their happiness, than
the quietude of civilized life, from which they could receive no
enjoyment, and to which they could only give pain.</p>
<p>It is also worthy of remark, that some patients sink more
rapidly into moping idiotcy when kept in a state of perfect
seclusion, than they even do in the society of those who are
insane like themselves.</p>
<p>I have seen patients who had not been accustomed to any
association, who were, on their first arrival, in appearance,
manners, behaviour, especially in their mode of eating, and their
dirty habits, scarcely human; it was evident from all this, that
they had long been unaccustomed to the common conveniences and
decencies of life, as well as from the astonishment <a
name="page2_54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and delight
they first exhibit, on these things being restored to
them;&mdash;to see companions, and to find a table with the usual
appendages of knives and forks, &amp;c. evidently excited
pleasing reminiscences and gave them additional life,&mdash;their
improvement (externally, at any rate) was rapid, and, by
continued attention, their restoration to habits of cleanliness
complete.</p>
<p>To insure all these as well as many other advantages, and to
make cure the primary object, requires not only that the
proprietor should live amongst them, but also that he should be a
medical man, and one who has experience, guided by upright
principles and Christian feelings; for if medical men of talent
and character could be induced to undertake this painful and
anxious life, submitting cheerfully to all these sacrifices and
inconveniences, much might be done to improve this neglected
department of medicine, and augment the number of cures; at all
events, most certainly increase the comforts of the incurable,
and lessen the distressing apprehensions of those who fear the
accession, or recurrence of mental aberration; yet
notwithstanding the paramount importance of these things, so
ignorant or so blinded by prejudice is the world on the subject,
and so little aware of the talents and capabilities required for
such a situation, that they consider the very name of a
proprietor, and superintendant of an asylum, as absolutely <a
name="page2_55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>sinking the
character in public estimation; whereas no class of medical men,
were they efficient, should be considered more honourable,
because none can be more useful than those who devote themselves
to the cure and comfort of persons in this most lamentable
state.</p>
<p>When the gloom and horror at present thrown around
establishments for the insane shall be cleared away,
Dante&rsquo;s inscription over the gates of Hell, will be no
longer applicable to them,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lasciate ogni speranza, voi, ch&eacute;
ntrate;&rdquo; <a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>this, or perhaps another passage from Euripides, has been
imitated by our Milton,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here hope never comes, which comes to
all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They will be considered houses of cure, or hospitals for the
insane.</p>
<p>The erroneous and false impressions, concerning the character
and state of the insane, will be corrected.&nbsp; The popular
impression, that they are all violent and vociferous, destructive
and dangerous, will be removed.&nbsp; Hitherto medical writers,
by selecting the most striking cases, have contributed their
share to this popular error.&nbsp; They have been led to do this,
partly because they are cases, which more naturally arrest their
own observation; but chiefly, because they are more easily
described; make a <a name="page2_56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>more interesting picture, and are the most
curable.&nbsp; A statement of the recovery of such patients,
though it may serve to exalt the writer in public estimation, is
wrong in itself, and very injurious in its influence; for it
increases the unreasonable horrors and false impressions
entertained about the insane, and propagates and perpetuates the
evils of which the public and legislature complain.&nbsp; They
receive impressions from extreme cases, which average about five
per cent. then speak just as if all the insane were in a similar
condition.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Tuke says, &ldquo;Many errors in the construction,
as well as in the management, of asylums for the insane, appear
to arise from excessive attention to safety; people in general
have the most erroneous notions of the constantly outrageous
behaviour, or malicious dispositions of deranged persons; and it
has in many instances, been found convenient to encourage these
sentiments, to apologize for the treatment of the unhappy
sufferers, or admit the vicious neglect of their
attendants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the construction of such places, cure and comfort ought to
be as much considered as security; and I have no hesitation in
declaring, that a system which, by limiting the power of the
attendant, obliges him not to neglect his duty, and makes it his
interest to obtain the good opinion of those under his care,
provides <a name="page2_57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>more effectually for the safety of the keeper, as well
as of the patient, than all &ldquo;the apparatus of chains,
darkness, and anodynes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safety of those who attend upon the insane, is
certainly an object of great importance; but it is worthy of
enquiry whether it may not be attained, without materially
interfering with another object, the recovery of the
patient.&nbsp; It may also deserve enquiry, whether the extensive
practice of coercion, which obtains in some institutions, does
not arise from erroneous views of the character of insane
persons; from indifference to their comfort, or from having
rendered coercion necessary by previous unkind
treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is another fact to be considered, not hitherto
contemplated by any writer, and which is well expressed in a
letter I received from a friend, in answer to one requesting his
opinion in a case <a name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a> wherein its importance has been shown
to demonstration.&nbsp; He says, (and he is a man of great
humanity,) &ldquo;I am most solicitous that the distinction
should be understood between those who cannot act and think or
decide for themselves, and those who can, and who, sensible of
their defective state, or of the approach even of absolute
derangement, can of their own free will, place themselves in a
situation, where they know that every medical <a
name="page2_58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>and moral
means will be used for their restoration.&nbsp; It is of the
utmost importance, that the legislature should have it completely
demonstrated to them, that there is a condition of the insane
never contemplated by any legislator; the judicious management of
which, is of the greatest consequence to them.&nbsp; Instead of
the mental malady being allowed to proceed, until the sufferer is
introduced into these retreats by force, its first approaches
will be yielded to as soon as recognised, and the unhappy
individual, whilst still in the possession of reason, will
voluntarily or by gentle and affectionate solicitations, enter
some refuge for mental distress, where, separated and secluded
from the scenes and circumstances which were hurrying on
intellectual destruction, he may, in a short period, in a
condition of comparative happiness, escape the most tremendous
calamity with which human nature can be assailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe all the former evils connected with the management
of the insane, have arisen from ignorance of their state; and
therefore I am anxious to be perfectly understood, and labour
most earnestly to correct this erroneous impression; and not only
so, but I wish to prove the popular prejudice, that they are all
ill treated, to be no where, as far as my knowledge extends, true
or deserved; neither am I aware that this branch of medicine has
been more abused than others; nor do I know in <a
name="page2_59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>all my
experience, of any unjust confinement for interest&rsquo;s sake;
there may be ignorance of the treatment required, but surely in
these enlightened times, a medical man of any character can never
lend himself to any thing so suicidal to his own fair character
and prospects.&nbsp; I know, on the contrary, of evils arising
from over caution in the other extreme.&nbsp; I am perfectly
convinced that no insane person, should be without medical
superintendance, and that to be placed singly in private houses,
not medical, I know from experience to be sometimes most fatal
and destructive; some few, it is true, are above all praise.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Halliday after stating the number of insane, who
are known and registered according to act of Parliament, says,
&ldquo;there is a number, if not equally great, at least nearly
so, of whom the law takes no cognizance, and whose existence is
known only to their relations and friends.&nbsp; These consist of
individuals placed in solitary confinement, with persons who take
only one patient.&nbsp; This is a state of things which ought not
to be allowed to remain as it is, for a single hour, in this
boasted land of liberty; I do not say, that it ever has taken
place, though I have known one or two instances that might almost
bear such a construction;&mdash;but I maintain that it may take
place, for there is no law to prevent it; that <a
name="page2_60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>individuals
may have been sent into such seclusion, who never suffered from
the pangs of madness; and it must be evident to every one who
gives this subject the least consideration, that it only requires
a faithful keeper, and that watchfulness, to retain such a person
in prison for life.&nbsp; This number is said to have been
prodigiously increased by the new Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time it must be allowed, that many incipient
cases, requiring seclusion and separation from friends, would be
aggravated by too sudden an introduction amongst masses of insane
patients; and even by the very circumstance of arriving when
there is the chance of exciting the usual horror and prejudice
entertained against such places; but this ought not, and would
not be the case, were the plans and systems of classification I
have advocated, carried into practice.&nbsp; Every way and in
every thing, we have imperfections and abuses; and it is much
easier to condemn than to cure them; and they who at once believe
abuses exist in proportion to the popular description that is
given during some temporary excitement and prejudice, are not
safe persons to have the important charge of removing them.&nbsp;
I make these remarks, to show, that while a paternal government
is justly, most anxious to protect the persons and property of
those who can no longer protect and defend themselves, they <a
name="page2_61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>should at
the same time remember, that sanity of mind is still of much
higher value; and that therefore concern about the property
should not out weigh our concern for the cure.</p>
<p>I say nothing in the mean time, of the degrading suspicion and
paralyzing interference, which the best and most conscientious
man may under such system feel, in proceeding with the plans
which, he from experience, knows to be essential to their
restoration; but I contend, that the <i>common error in
legislation</i>, <i>of making property of more value than
life</i>, must here as well as wherever it is committed, have a
baneful influence.&nbsp; In this instance, the acts or laws made
under the influence of this very great and very selfish delusion,
produce this very serious mischief, that they tend to increase
the prejudice and aversion common to places of this description,
some of which would otherwise be considered not merely
unobjectionable places of residence, but places of seclusion,
very agreeable in themselves, and most desirable as places of
cure.</p>
<p>In many complaints, change of scene and association, are
justly considered necessary to the restoration of health.&nbsp;
It is not only the same in many cases of insanity but absolutely
the first and most important step in every system which gives
them a chance of restoration.&nbsp; Should then a bare residence
in any place for the mere purpose of cure, be accompanied (in <a
name="page2_62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>very many
cases, it is unnecessary,) by an act which is considered as
fixing the mark of degradation upon them, any more than it should
in any other disease?&nbsp; This, instead of healing, is
calculated to crush a heart already breaking; it is often fatal
to their recovery! it is a principal cause of frequent
relapses!&nbsp; They feel a stigma, thus fixed on their
character, so confirming the prejudices of the world, and so
encouraging that distressing and fatal look of suspicion towards
them, that they are forced to feel that no one reposes any faith
in them; and if this feeling does not ultimately destroy all
comfort and confidence, all order and stability within them, it
must very much weaken that concentration of energy so necessary
to the successful exercise of all mental operations; and if their
minds are weakened by previous attacks, and not well sustained by
right principles, but on the contrary, like many others, merely
regulated by worldly principles and considerations, then, they
are not only deprived of the rock on which mind is based, but
also of all the motives and objects which stimulate to mental
action.&nbsp; In this state, what is mind but a sad wreck
floating on the fathomless ocean of life, at the mercy of every
wind and wave?&nbsp; To what else shall we compare its
situation?&mdash;It is like a city broken down and without walls,
any enemy may enter in, and overthrow <a
name="page2_63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>it.&nbsp;
Can we wonder then that persons whose minds are in this position,
and whose prospects in life are thus blasted, should have a
recurrence of the same awful visitation? or what is worse, that
they should constantly feel their spirits paralyzed, and a
melancholy gloom thus thrown over the remainder of their
existence!</p>
<p>To make it necessary in all cases to have certificates, so far
from being a security against abuse, is more likely to be a cloak
for those who may wish to take advantage of the patient&rsquo;s
defenceless state; whereas in cases of voluntary seclusion, there
can be no risk; for with such honourable confidence, we have at
once, the proof and the security that it cannot and will not be
abused.&nbsp; These, however, are not the most desirable inmates,
as it regards the ease and comfort of the superintendant, and
therefore no one can have any other motive in recommending this
practice of voluntary seclusion, but that which arises from the
conscientious consideration of its being more conducive to
cure.</p>
<p>That all should have the sanction and concurrence of medical
recommendation, is every way indispensable; but what I argue for
is, that this should be done, in the manner best calculated to
make it appear to the patient, that cure, and not mere
confinement, is the object of the measure they are recommended to
accede to <a name="page2_64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>without reluctance.&nbsp; That a great number will
require certificates, and all the aid of authority, to make them
submit to the measure, is certain; and in these cases, the law,
so far from being a hardship, is a great convenience and
advantage.</p>
<p>Again, violent and extreme cases may be said to certificate
themselves, in these there can be no risk of making any mistake,
and doing any injustice in the first instance; the injustice may
be afterwards in improper treatment, and in over detention.&nbsp;
But to prevent all such abuses, we must first make men perfect,
and then we should have no diseases to cure.&nbsp; It is certain,
that under a proper system, ameliorated by all these plans of
procedure I have stated, it is astonishing how these violent and
extreme cases would become less prominent.&nbsp; I believe they
would not average five per cent. at any one time; and take the
average of a number of years, and I suppose it would not be more
than half that number.&nbsp; I am certain the proportion, during
sixteen years of my experience, has been much less than even
this; it is seven years since we had occasion to treat any one
single case as a constantly furious and dangerous maniac; and
even suppose, such cases, under the best management, were more
frequent in occurrence, and continue in this state for some time,
how easy it would be so <a name="page2_65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>to contrive an Establishment, that
these violent cases should not annoy or disturb the rest; and
when thus managed, so far from their influence being hurtful,
they would become interesting and salutary objects of reflection
and commiseration to those who are in a better state; and often,
by example, would teach the greatest of all moral lessons, that
which holds the primary place as a preventive, and is always a
necessary adjunct in the business of restoration&mdash;self
control.</p>
<p>In fact, every system of management that does not make this
principle, of mildly calling forth and gently exercising this
internal principle of self-control on matters that are least
connected with the diseased parts of the brain, a constant and
primary object of attention, is not merely defective, but
exhibits very great ignorance of the attributes of mind, as well
as of the causes and nature of its maladies; and it follows that,
as a system, it must be without any clear principle to guide its
physical and moral treatment.&nbsp; In all things, we ought to
remember, and especially in a matter of such importance, that we
can do good only so far as our knowledge extends; and even this
knowledge is useless, unless we are zealously desirous and able
to reduce it to practice.&nbsp; Whatever may be our proportion of
knowledge, zeal, and ability, it cannot be arrogance, when called
<a name="page2_66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>upon, to
say, that I believe this principle is more brought into practice
by the plans and arrangements I have described, than is the case
with any system of treatment in any place that I have hitherto
heard of or seen.</p>
<p>It is not known, as it ought to be, how powerful with the
higher class of patients is the principle of honour; with many, a
sense of religion; and with <i>all</i>, the fear of losing the
approbation and friendship of those who are kind to them; as well
as, from selfish motives, to secure the liberty and indulgences
they have enjoyed.&nbsp; These means, and every principle which
operates on human nature as checks on one part of the mind, and
as encouragements to another, should be constantly and steadily
kept in view, for the purpose of never losing an opportunity of
instantly bringing them into useful, and of course successful,
operation.</p>
<p>It is on this philosophical system of kindness, that every
thing should be so contrived that the principle of internal
self-control should be excited, and kept in exercise; and thus,
being brought to depend somewhat on themselves, the depressing
effects of the absolute restraint of fear, induced by harsh
measures, and the tyranny into which a mere place of confinement
with walls, and bolts and bars, must almost necessarily
degenerate, is avoided.</p>
<p><a name="page2_67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>The
propriety of these measures will receive additional confirmation,
when we come to consider the causes as well as the nature of the
evils which we are called upon to combat; but it may in the mean
time be sufficient to state the appalling fact, that insanity is
very often the consequence of early over indulgence.&mdash;I have
frequently had to remark that an only child,&mdash;the youngest,
or one brought up by a grandmother,&mdash;were the victims of a
system of gratifying the feelings, without due attention to the
cultivation and exercise of the understanding, as the delegated
power destined to guide the future man.</p>
<p>There are few minds, even amongst the insane, who are not
accessible to the salutary influence of this kind and liberal
mode of proceeding.&nbsp; It is true, that many paupers, who have
long been subjected to a very different system, are scarcely
receptive of any of the impressions which belong to human nature;
but with a higher class of patients, this can seldom or never be
the case, unless it be in cases of absolute dementia.&nbsp; Even
in the height of the most furious paroxysms, it is astonishing
how much may be done by liberality and kindness.&nbsp; Nothing
but absolute necessity should justify absolute restraint.&nbsp;
It must always be considered as an evil to which we are reduced,
in order to avoid a greater.&nbsp; Whenever it is unnecessary, <a
name="page2_68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>and
continued too long, it will do more harm than good: the furious
will be made more furious, and the suicide more determined to
effect his purpose.&nbsp; Whenever the patient is indulged with
more liberty and behaves better, we must have forbearance to the
utmost extent, and submit to all possible risks, losses, and
expenses, rather than again have recourse to it; and when it is
repeated, the patient must be made, if possible, to feel that it
is deserved.</p>
<p>Their faults, like those of children, must be viewed with
pity.&nbsp; They are the wild displays of feeling, without
understanding.&nbsp; We must make excuses for them; often
overlook, as often visit them slightly, only seldom with
seriousness, and always with moderation, justice, and
prudence.&nbsp; No evil is greater than the evil of constantly
chiding and suspiciously watching for faults.&nbsp; It is an evil
spirit that poisons and inflames every thing within its
sphere.&nbsp; A contrary spirit has a healing influence; and
though it requires numerous attendants, and makes the whole
business of superintending the insane a source of constant and
intense anxiety and solicitude, yet it is pleasing to have it in
my power to state many &ldquo;striking&rdquo; examples of its
efficacy, but I shall, notwithstanding, content myself with only
slightly glancing at two or three.</p>
<h3><a name="page2_69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span><i>No.</i> 372.</h3>
<p>I shall not at present give the particulars of this
interesting case, except so far as is necessary for the purposes
of illustration.</p>
<p>When he came from a private Asylum, he was in a state of the
most furious, destructive, and malignant excitement, and had been
in this state for so many months, that he was considered by his
friends as an incurable case.</p>
<p>I attribute his cure, chiefly to his being treated with
apparent confidence, and induced to work with a spade, when even
in his worst state&mdash;a state so dreadful, that the least word
or wrong look would have roused him to commit some dreadful act
of vengeance, and it therefore required two men to be constantly
in attendance to watch him, and this without appearing to do
so.</p>
<p>He was induced to work with willingness, by being brought to
believe he had the contrivance, management, and superintendance,
of some improvements in the place; such as some alterations in
the garden, and especially that of making a new road from one
house to another, which now bears his name.&nbsp; It was
observed, that after a hard day&rsquo;s work, especially if he
had profusely perspired, he had a more sound night&rsquo;s sleep,
and awoke somewhat improved in the morning; it is, however, to be
remarked, <a name="page2_70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>that all this time he continued to have a regular system
of medical treatment, which consisted in small repeated bleedings
with leeches, averaging about three times in the fortnight, with
purgatives, alteratives, and salines.&nbsp; It is impossible to
conceive the delicacy that was observed towards him.&nbsp; Not a
word or a look was done to offend him, let him speak or act ever
so provokingly; and he was as perverse and as provoking, as it is
possible to conceive a perfect d&aelig;mon to be.&nbsp; His was
the exclusive excitement of anger and malignity, combined with
the most acute cunning to effect his destructive purposes.&nbsp;
The serpent, the wolf, the tiger, and vulture, seemed all that
remained of the man.&nbsp; In this state, to bring the better
parts of his mind into life, was a great difficulty.&nbsp;
However, perseverance in this system restored him; and never was
gratitude greater, or more substantially evinced, than has been
by his conduct, and by that of his friends.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I can truly say, with Dr. Haslam, that &ldquo;by gentleness of
manner and kindness of treatment, I have seldom failed to obtain
the confidence, and conciliate the esteem, of insane persons; and
have succeeded, by these means, in procuring from them respect
and obedience;&rdquo; and I am of the same opinion with Mr.
Samuel Tuke, wherein he states &ldquo;that a large majority <a
name="page2_71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>of the
instances, in which the malevolent dispositions are peculiarly
apparent, and are considered as characterising the disorder, may
readily be traced to secondary causes; arising from the peculiar
circumstances of the patient, or from the mode of
management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that where the patients have known the
superintendants when in a convalescent state, or in a state still
capable of estimating the kindness shown to them, they will much
more readily submit, and show much less of anger and
vindictiveness, even in their insane state.&nbsp; This effect
will be still more striking, if they have been in a place where a
severer system is practiced, and where they have become depraved
and brutalised, by being subject to too much coercion.&nbsp; Of
this I shall state as much of a very interesting case as may
illustrate this great and important principle.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 395, <i>admitted Dec.</i> 3, 1829.</h3>
<p>This patient, on her first admission, was suspicious,
vindictive, and implacable,&mdash;refusing food, and medicines,
&amp;c.&mdash;after recovery, and returning voluntarily, she was
confiding, affectionate, and submissive, comparatively, even in
her worst state.</p>
<p>On my seeing her at her own home, at the time of her second
admission, she instantly <a name="page2_72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good God! had you
been here three days before, you had saved me!&rdquo;&nbsp; On
asking if she would like to return with me, she instantly said,
&ldquo;above all things in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; She came, and
was apparently well in about ten days, and so continued for about
seven weeks, when she returned home: but in less than a week she
came back in the most raving and furious state, and yet nothing
apparently dangerous or vindictive; on the contrary, she showed
affection and attachment to us all; and if she displayed any
vindictiveness, it was connected with some past recollections:
but this has been slight and evanescent, compared to that which
she exhibited in her former state;&mdash;a testimony, even from
among the insane, which shows how much depends on the directions
we give to each other&rsquo;s mental energies.&nbsp; In this
case, long walks in the most secluded parts of the forest, often
removed or lessened an approaching paroxysm, and always
superseded the necessity of having recourse to any restrictive
measures.&nbsp; She is now perfectly recovered, and returned
home.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Now, it is evident that ferocious and furious maniacs are
those, wherein a direct system of coercion is said to be
essential; and yet it is evident, that these are cases where it
must do the greatest injury.&nbsp; They are those in which <a
name="page2_73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the animal
part is excited and inflamed, and of course all causes of
irritation must increase it.&nbsp; It is adding fuel to the fire,
which already burns too fiercely&mdash;it is lacerating a wound
which requires to be mollified with ointment.&nbsp; The
best-tempered house-dog becomes savage by being constantly
chained.</p>
<p>Restraint and coercion are only justified when used either
from absolute necessity, or as the mildest species of discipline;
and then in all instances it <i>must</i> be proportioned to the
causes and exigencies of the case; or when they are so violent,
or so unconscious of their own state, or so bent on their own
destruction, that there is less evil to be feared by restraint,
than by indulgence.&mdash;But even here, popular feelings,
prejudices, and fears, must not be the judges.</p>
<p>The word coercion has been used, but it conveys an erroneous
impression, as if some degree of punishment were necessarily
included in the restraint which the safety of others and of the
patients require; but so far from this being the case, it ought
never to be forgotten, that if the murderous and destructive
maniac are made to feel, that with this necessary restraint is
conjoined the indulgence of a vindictive spirit of retaliation,
it will have an injurious influence, aggravate the disease, and
of course will progressively increase the necessity and rigour of
the restraint.</p>
<p><a name="page2_74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>In
cases of determination to suicide, it should be made to appear to
the patient, what in truth it always should be&mdash;the kindest
guardianship and protection.&nbsp; In cases of some lesser
faults, or such as breaking or tearing, instead of restraint, a
small dark closet I have found more useful than the strait
waistcoat; yet neither the one nor the other, have, now for a
long time, (seven years at least) scarcely ever been resorted to,
for more than an hour or so; but to be able to do all this
requires a superabundance of servants and attendants, and these
must be serious, active, laborious, and vigilant as possible.</p>
<p>I have known cases where the patient himself, on feeling his
destructive propensity coming upon him, requested that he might
be placed under restraint, and he felt afterwards more
comfortable, from the conviction that he was safer in that
state.&nbsp; In such a case, the request should be readily
attended to, as being not merely unobjectionable, but likely to
have a beneficial influence.</p>
<p>It has been, that restraint was resorted to, from the idleness
and carelessness of keepers; and in these cases, when restrained,
being neglected, they acquired dirty habits, very often, simply
from the effect of custom inducing a disregard and insensibility
to the discomfort of their filthy state; sometimes they acquired
these <a name="page2_75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>habits, from, in the first instance, a determined
vindictive motive of teasing those whom they thought had acted
unjustly towards them, as the only means they had in their power
of gratifying their revenge.&nbsp; In cases of debility and
approaching marasmus, the effects of retention, when they are
thus deprived of the power of relieving themselves, soon destroys
the natural and healthy functions of the sphincters.&nbsp; I have
often known a contrary system cure all these habits especially in
the two first class of cases mentioned; though, in other
respects, the mind remained the same.&nbsp; In the case last
described, good and judicious management may retard the progress
of the disease; but the system gradually decays, like a tree
stripped of its bark by lightning.</p>
<p>As a proof, we have only a choice of evils, and we must always
choose the least, I shall state a case.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 421.</h3>
<p>This patient who had been several times under my care, was one
who was soon made worse both in his bodily and mental state, by
any restraint, however mild; and therefore we submitted to the
losses which his very destructive habits occasioned, rather than
have recourse to them.&nbsp; These losses were enormous.&nbsp; By
this treatment, he so far recovered, that a <a
name="page2_76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>medical
friend, who had known him all his life, declared, on an
accidental interview in the grounds, that his mind seemed in a
state of integrity, as perfect as he had ever known it to be
previous to the accession of any symptoms of Insanity.</p>
<p>In this state, he was removed by his friends from, I believe,
parsimonious motives, to Bedlam, and this was done in spite of my
positive opinion, declared in writing, that it would be fatal to
his bodily and mental health, and that he would sink under the
depressing effects of his situation.&nbsp; In less than six
months, he was covered with ulcers, and a mass of disease.&nbsp;
In this state he was removed to his own house in the country,
where he recovered his bodily health, but his mind is gone for
ever.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I could adduce, to illustrate the same principle, many cases
similar to the last, and indeed so powerfully have I felt
impressed with its importance, that I have frequently written
letters to, and had conversations with, the friends of patients,
stating, that from the nature and state of their case, we had
only a choice of evils, and therefore it was better to run the
risk of rather overmuch liberty, than the positive evils of
goading and exasperating them by what is generally deemed,
particularly in these cases, necessary restraints and
confinement.&nbsp; <a name="page2_77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>In most instances, they have not only
fully entered into my views, and given me their necessary
co-operation, but also readily agreed, that, if in consequence of
this liberty any accident should happen, they would acquit me of
all blame, and we have hitherto been most providentially favoured
in having none of any moment.&nbsp; It is true, one very peculiar
patient takes advantage of this indulgence, and visits his
friends without leave of absence; but so far from any blame or
anger on the part of his friends against us on this account, they
are pleased to see him, and he is always on these occasions very
happy with the idea of having given us so much trouble, and at
the same time, he shows he esteems our kindness by willingly,
readily, and cheerfully returning to us.&nbsp; Indeed as we have
no case which better illustrates the principle for which I am
contending, I shall here introduce so much of its description, as
may be necessary for the purpose of enforcing its importance.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 396.</h3>
<p>It is a case, where little insanity is observable in his
conversation, but appears almost altogether in this constant
propensity to indulge in destructiveness&mdash;breaking windows,
tearing his clothes, &amp;c.&nbsp; The more costly the articles
he destroys, the more pleasure he <a name="page2_78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>seems to have in the indulgence of
this propensity for mischief and evil.&nbsp; By over-much
confinement and coercion, this patient would soon have become a
settled case of furious and destructive mania; but by great
liberality, and using restraint occasionally, the habit is much
lessened: still, however, the propensity exists, and might be
easily aggravated.&nbsp; A week of the usual coercive measures,
would make this case degenerate into one equally malignant and
murderous as that of Walsh, whose character is given in the
Sketches of Bedlam.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A great number of cases might be adduced in support of these
views; but I trust these may suffice to enforce the argument in
favour of the system, which some have blamed, as being too
liberal and indulgent.&nbsp; I have therefore quoted a few such
cases, both as an illustration of my views and motives, and also
as the best apology and vindication I can give in my own
defence.</p>
<p>In all violent cases, there is one remark that must not be
forgotten&mdash;that when it is possible, good may often be
expected from violent exercise, always taking care that the
patient is in a state to bear the fatigue, and still more so if
he undertakes any sort of exercise with voluntary pleasure.&nbsp;
In cases, however, sinking into marasmus,&mdash;cases which I
class under those of gradual decay of mind&mdash;exercise must be
undertaken at <a name="page2_79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>suitable seasons, and when in a proper state, and must
always be gentle and moderate.&nbsp; Besides, though the greatest
good may be expected in almost all cases from labour and
exercise, properly regulated, and willingly undertaken, it is to
be remarked, that while, with a great proportion of a pauper
class of patients, various kinds of labour and exercise are, from
their previous habits, easily adopted, and soon, by vigilant
management, reduced to a regular system, and such system is of
paramount importance to their health and mental restoration; yet
with a higher class of patients, who had not acquired at an early
period of life regular habits of industry, even the attempt to do
the same thing might be altogether as difficult and injurious;
and therefore though exercise is of very great importance, this
should not make us overlook the necessity of not urging and
compelling them to it in a way to cause irritation, unless
indeed, in some extreme perverse cases, who must be forced to
walk or ride rather than their health suffer from deficiency of
air and exercise.&nbsp; What I mean is, that we must avoid doing
a positive evil where the good is only probable.&nbsp; For though
exercise is one of the most powerful means of withdrawing the
determination of the nervous energy and blood from the head, and
distributing them properly through the whole system, and thus
combining a mental <a name="page2_80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and physical power of diversion to
the train of thoughts which injuriously occupy and produce a
destructive fire in the mind, fatal to its existence; yet in
these cases, we may produce a greater irritation by unnecessary
compulsion.&nbsp; It is well known, that in many cases, besides
the animal and angry passions being very active, pride and vanity
are with many, if not the whole cause and very seat, often parts
of the disease; and that when once excited, all moral means to
restrain and subdue them are as futile as it would be to attempt
by artificial aid to quench the fury of a burning volcano.</p>
<p>I have often, however, known the violent maniacal excitement
very much lessened in force, and bettered in direction, by being
allowed, with an attendant, to ramble, and dance, and scream
about, in the secluded parts of the forest, for a whole day
together, and which superseded the necessity of the straight
waistcoat. <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a></p>
<p>When this class of patients cannot be induced to walk, they
may be pleased with carriage exercise, and in cases of
approaching marasmus, where much fatigue would be injurious,
airings will amuse and help to invigorate their feeble system,
and perhaps, retard in some degree, the progress of
destruction.</p>
<p><a name="page2_81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Though I have incidentally been led to notice the
importance of employment and amusement, as a remedial measure of
great efficacy among the insane; and though I could adduce many
further striking proofs of its being apparently the sole cause of
cure; I feel, to do so in this place, would be to forestall and
usurp a subject to which I intend (as it deserves) to devote a
separate essay; yet I cannot help saying, that I have some recent
cases in proof of its efficacy, that were it not that their
peculiar character and employment is so striking, that to
describe them, would be almost to name them, I should feel
tempted to bring them forward, for the purpose of proving that,
among a better class of patients, this employment must never, on
any account, be made a disagreeable task, but a matter of
pleasurable choice, if we mean it to have a beneficial
influence.&nbsp; This is often very difficult; a task requiring
great tact and no selfishness.&nbsp; I believe, considering the
class of patients we have under our charge, I am justified in
asserting, that there is no place where a greater number, or more
pains have been taken, and greater sacrifices made, so to employ
and amuse them.</p>
<p>Dr. Gregory used to mention the fact of a farmer, who, by
giving his patients, on their first admission, convincing proofs
of his undoubted strength and pugilistic pre-eminence, <a
name="page2_82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>brought
them to a state of passive obedience and non-resistance, and then
made them work; and, it is said, cured them.</p>
<p>No doubt many would be cured by this system, and these would
propagate his fame; but whether the quality and proportion of
those who would be injured by such a system, were greater evils
than the good which was thus effected, we have now no means of
ascertaining; nor is it necessary to know this, before we venture
to condemn a system so perfectly savage and quackishly
indiscriminate in its practice.</p>
<p>Where pride and vanity, angry passions, and love of power, are
active, we cannot, with impunity, force them to work against
their inclination; at the same time, it is our duty to lay the
axe to the root of the evil, and restrain, and if possible
subdue, these inordinate passions; but what I assert, is, that
these are very difficult and dangerous passions to encounter, and
they are not, with this class, to be restrained and subdued by
the mere authority of a tax-master.&nbsp; When we encounter them,
it must be with great mental power and moral force; and this,
even, to be exercised with effect, requires, that we first make
ourselves beloved and respected by them.&nbsp; Oh! it is a
difficult and delicate thing to preserve that spirit, in
combating <a name="page2_83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>these provoking cases, which alone has the power to
overcome and cure them.</p>
<p>A state of furious mania is frequently the effect of
injudicious management.&nbsp; Of this opinion, Mr. S. Tuke says,
&ldquo;a striking illustration occurred in this Institution, some
years ago.&nbsp; A patient, of rather a vindictive and
self-important character, who had previously conducted himself
with tolerable propriety, one day climbed up against a window,
which overlooked the court where he was confined, and amused
himself by contemplating the interior of the room.&nbsp; An
attendant, who had not been long in office, perceiving his
situation, ran hastily towards him, and, without preamble, drew
him to the ground.&nbsp; The patient was highly incensed: a
scuffle immediately ensued, in which he succeeded in throwing his
antagonist; and had not the loud vociferations of this attendant
alarmed the family, it is probable that he would have paid for
his rash conduct, by the loss of his life.&nbsp; The furious
state of the patient&rsquo;s mind did not continue long; but,
after this circumstance, he was more vindictive and
violent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some instances, the superintendant has known furious
mania temporarily induced, by the privations necessary on a
relapse, after a considerable lucid interval, during which the
patient had enjoyed many privileges that were incompatible with
his disordered state.&nbsp; Here <a name="page2_84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>we may suggest the expediency, where
it is possible, of employing such of the attendants to control
the patient during his paroxysms, as had little intercourse with
him in his lucid interval.&nbsp; Instances of furious mania have
been, however, very rare; but a considerable number of patients
have been admitted, who were reported to be so furiously insane
as to require constant coercion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evidence of attendants, who have been employed,
previously to the admission of patients into the retreat, is not
considered a sufficient reason for any extraordinary restraint;
and cases have occurred, in which persuasion and kind treatment
have superseded the necessity of any coercive means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some years ago, a man, about thirty-four years of age,
of almost Herculean size and figure, was brought to the
house.&nbsp; He had been afflicted several times before; and so
constantly, during the present attack, had he been kept chained,
that his clothes were contrived to be taken off and put on by
means of strings, without removing his manacles.&nbsp; They were,
however, taken off, when he entered the Retreat, and he was
ushered into the apartment where the superintendants were
supping.&nbsp; He was calm: his attention appeared to be arrested
by his new situation.&nbsp; He was desired to join in the repast,
during which he behaved with tolerable propriety.&nbsp; After it
was concluded, the superintendant <a name="page2_85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>conducted him to his apartment, and
told him the circumstances on which his treatment would depend;
that it was his anxious wish to make every inhabitant of the
house as comfortable as possible; and that he sincerely hoped the
patient&rsquo;s conduct would render it unnecessary for him to
have recourse to coercion.&nbsp; The maniac was sensible of the
kindness of his treatment.&nbsp; He promised to restrain himself,
and he so completely succeeded, that, during his stay, no
coercive means were ever employed towards him.&nbsp; This case
affords a striking example of the efficacy of mild
treatment.&nbsp; The patient was frequently very vociferous, and
threatened his attendants, who in their defence were very
desirous of restraining him by the jacket.&nbsp; The
superintendant, on these occasions, went to his apartment; and
though the first sight of him seemed rather to increase the
patient&rsquo;s irritation; yet after sitting some time quietly
beside him, the violent excitement subsided, and he would listen
with attention to the persuasions and arguments of his friendly
visitor.&nbsp; After such conversations, the patient was
generally better for some days or a week; and in about four
months he was discharged, perfectly recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be doubted, that, in this case, the disease had
been greatly exasperated by the mode of management? or that the
subsequent <a name="page2_86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>kind treatment had a great tendency to promote his
recovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may probably be urged, and I am very well aware of
it, that there is a considerable class of patients, whose
eccentricities may, in great measure, be controlled; and who may
be kept in subjection and apparent orderly habits, by the strong
excitement of the principle of fear.&mdash;They may be made to
obey their keepers, with the greatest promptitude; to rise, to
sit, to stand, to walk, or run at their pleasure; though only
expressed by a look.&nbsp; Such an obedience, and even the
appearance of affection, we not unfrequently see in the poor
animals who are exhibited to gratify our curiosity in natural
history: but who can avoid reflecting, in observing such
spectacles, that the readiness with which the savage tiger obeys
his master, is the result of treatment, at which humanity would
shudder; and shall we propose by such means</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To calm the tumult of the breast,<br />
Which madness has too long possest;<br />
To chase away the fiend Despair,<br />
To clear the brow of gloomy care;<br />
Bid pensive Melancholy cease to mourn,<br />
Calm Reason reassume her seat;<br />
Each intellectual power return?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If those who are friendly to what may be termed the
terrific system of management, could <a name="page2_87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>prove, that notwithstanding it may
fix for life the misery of a large majority of the melancholies;
and drive many of the more irritable maniacs to fury or
desperation; yet that it is still, in its operation upon a large
scale, adapted to promote the cure of insanity; they would have
some apology for its discriminate adoption.&nbsp; If, on the
contrary, a statement of the proportion of cures in the Retreat,
shall sufficiently prove the superior efficacy of mild means,
would not those, who are adopting an opposite line of treatment,
do well to reflect on the awful responsibility which attaches to
their conduct.&nbsp; Let us all constantly remember, that there
is a Being, to whose eye darkness is light; who sees the inmost
recesses of the dungeon, and who has declared, &lsquo;For the
sighing of the poor, and the crying of the needy, I will
arise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the view we have now taken of the propriety of
exciting fear, as a means of promoting the cure of insanity, by
enabling the patient to control himself, it will, perhaps, be
almost superfluous to state as our opinion, that the idea, which
has too generally obtained, of it being necessary to commence an
acquaintance with lunatics, by an exhibition of strength, or an
appearance of austerity, is utterly erroneous.&nbsp; The
sentiment appears allied to that cruel system, probably dictated
by indolence and timidity, <a name="page2_88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>which has so long prevailed, and
unhappily still prevails, in many receptacles for the
insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much analogy between the judicious treatment
of children, and that of insane persons.&nbsp; Locke has observed
that &lsquo;the great secret of education, lies in finding the
way to keep the child&rsquo;s spirit easy, active, and free; and
yet, at the same time, to restrain him from many things he has a
mind to, and to draw him to many things which are uneasy to
him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is highly desirable that the attendants on lunatics should
possess this influence over their minds, but it will never be
obtained by austerity and rigour; nor will assumed consequence
and airs of self-importance be generally more successful; at the
same time, it must be acknowledged that as insanity is often the
consequence of over-indulgence, as well as of a system of
tyranny, while under parental care, that therefore both extremes
are to be, not only avoided, but their effects counteracted by a
judicious and curative system of treatment, and that this will
require to be varied according to the peculiarities of each
individual case.</p>
<p>A private establishment, where cure and reformation are thus
conjoined, becomes an interesting little world of its own.&nbsp;
Though to live in this world is a life of ceaseless anxiety,
there is such a perpetual succession of such an endless and
inconceivable variety of strange <a name="page2_89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>incidents and speeches, odd displays
of feelings and manners, inside views of the human heart, and, as
it were, of the invisible world, that the charms of novelty, the
excitements of wonder, the enquiries of reason, and the demands
of sympathy, keep the mind so alive, that I have often observed
that the revolutions of the sun seem to run their course more
rapidly now, than before I lived among them.&nbsp; And though the
feeling of being excluded from rational society, often presents
itself to the mind as a terrible sacrifice to those whose
earliest and fondest wish was to live in the sphere of intellect
and genius, yet we are often reminded that they are not always
irrational, that some, are so only on a single point, while on
every other they possess more than common powers of pleasing;
others, are in a state of convalescence, and many of them are,
for a while at least, grateful and amiable in the extreme; and it
is delightful to see those who awake from a lost or raving state,
as from a sound sleep or a disturbed dream, with all the
freshness of joyous gratitude and celestial ecstacy, on suddenly
beholding a new world of mind and matter bursting upon
them.&nbsp; So that if we cannot always exist in an intellectual
sphere, we are seldom without that of affection and gratitude;
and though it is difficult to prevent, in such scenes as must
often assail us, occasional paroxysms <a
name="page2_90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>of
discontent and wearisomeness coming over us, they seldom last
long, and they are sometimes cured, as well as brought on, by an
occasional peep into the motley world.</p>
<p>Shut out from the world, one is as apt at one time, on again
entering into it, to be as much oversurprised and delighted with
the blessed fire-side scenes where the wise and good man resides,
as one is at another time to be equally over-disappointed and
revolted with the follies and miseries of the moral insanities
which exist unrestrained among men in real life.&nbsp; Nor do I
conceive we have more appalling consequences of disobedience to
the natural and divine laws of our being, in this place, than can
be seen in the world, walking in wantonness in the broad light of
the noon-day sun.</p>
<p>Insanity is, no doubt, a terrible visitation, but why should
we allow a false and unreasonable horror to increase it, and why
should we thus sever our sympathy from a disease which more than
any other requires it?&nbsp; The medicinal virtues of the fruits
of charity are best proved amongst them.&nbsp; Grant that the
disease arises from some remote or proximate ill-directed mental
states.&nbsp; Why should we have more horror of insanity, than
many other consequences of ill-regulated minds.&mdash;To me, the
foul ward of some large public Hospital, is incomparably more
horrible and loathsome.&mdash;<a name="page2_91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Such direct consequences of
wickedness present the object before us in an aspect that makes
it difficult for us to exercise any feelings of commiseration
towards them.&nbsp; Not so the insane! but these are views,
however, into the consideration of which, I shall not enter in
this place; but I mention or rather hint at the diseases of other
organs, for the purpose of asserting that the reality and
appearance of the miserable state of the insane is not so
shocking as people imagine, but that still I allow it is an awful
visitation.</p>
<p>But while I allow this, it is at the same time the strongest
reason why we should be anxious to remove all those false and
unreasonable horrors, which can only aggravate the calamity, by
giving countenance to the imaginary necessity of having recourse
to harsh measures,&mdash;one ceases with the other,&mdash;it will
not only do this, but it will also, I repeat, remove those
depressing feelings of degradation which, whenever reason gleams,
is death to their hopes, and which often prevents their recovery,
brings on relapses, and is the most painful and heartrending
feeling they have to contend against in the critical and
incipient stage of their convalescence.</p>
<p>By this system of greater liberality, it would soon be found,
that patients would no longer consist of violent and extreme
cases alone, <a name="page2_92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>but that every thing repulsive in their present state
and aspect would quickly disappear, their whole character assume
a milder form in reality as well as in appearance.&mdash;Indeed,
this is already the case.&nbsp; All things are improved.&nbsp;
Thus popular prejudice ought to cease, and a more favourable
prepossession should occupy its place; and the world being fully
persuaded, that there is much more to hope than to fear from a
residence at such a place, persons at the commencement of the
malady are easily induced to enter them of their own accord, or
are sent by their friends without delay or reluctance, before the
disease has passed the curable stage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cases,&rdquo;
as a friend of mine justly observes, &ldquo;were this feeling
fully established, would be relieved without proceeding to the
utmost degree of severity; and we might confidently anticipate
that when the decided excellence of such a system, as regards
moral, intellectual, and physical management, is adequately
understood, the premonitory symptoms, often slight and various,
but generally significant, will no longer be disregarded: and
incipient mental disease, arrested by the judicious means there
pursued, will not be allowed to assume a form and magnitude
constituting the most awful calamity to which man is
subject:&rdquo; and why should it be allowed to do so, when it
may be asserted, without contradiction, that functional disorders
<a name="page2_93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>of the
brain, are less liable to end in disorganization, and possess a
greater power of readjustment, than any other part of the human
system&mdash;woe unto us if it were not so.</p>
<p>The advantages which may arise from this system will appear in
a still more striking point of view, when we reflect that those
cases which without proper care in the early stages of the
disease ultimately become the worst and the most dangerous, are
precisely those which are fatally neglected, in the first
instance, and which are scarcely ever placed under any medical
treatment or moral discipline until the evil is past all
remedy.&nbsp; Cases of suspension and cases of gradual decay of
mind, as well as cases of Hypochondria, are of this
description.&nbsp; I had lately applications to receive three
patients of the latter description, all of whom committed suicide
during the delay between the application and the intended
removal.</p>
<p>It is true, there are cases, which require a very delicate,
and conditional sort of superintendance, and that harsh measures
and indiscriminate treatment would, in many instances, be more
injurious than even absolute neglect; but at the same time, it
must be observed, that such persons generally require to be
placed under some judicious and delicate restraint, from the fact
that their vicious inclination (for in these cases the disease
begins in chronic inflammation <a name="page2_94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>and ultimately softening of the
cerebellum) leading them into vicious habits, would rapidly
accelerate the disease and make it a confirmed and incurable
case.&nbsp; I have had some cases of gradual decay of mind,
which, if not curable, might, with care, have continued for years
in a tolerable state, but when allowed their liberty only for one
week, they so accelerated the progress of the disease by
dissipation and excess, that they suddenly sank into hopeless
idiotcy.</p>
<p>I have known several such cases, who were never under any
care, but left wholly to themselves, sink as suddenly into the
same hopeless state.&mdash;Cases of Melancholia and Suicide, are
often unsafe; the first is not a less decided case, though less
avowed and acknowledged inclination to suicide; the other, though
avowed will often pretend to be much better; sometimes even
strongly confess their guilt in having allowed themselves to
indulge in so dreadful a propensity; and all this, merely for the
purpose of throwing their friends off their guard; when, the
moment they suspend their vigilance, the suicide seizes with
avidity whatever means or opportunity may be presented to him, to
terminate his present miserable state of existence.</p>
<p>It is evident that to pursue this system, it will require
great anxiety and vigilance, and that we must not care for labour
or sacrifices <a name="page2_95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>but seek to do good for the sake of the good to be done;
and when this is the case, we shall be most desirous thoroughly
to understand every form and species of the disease, for we shall
then know that it requires that we should, with the utmost nicety
be able to discriminate between the different forms and species
of insanity, in order that we may discover, prescribe,
superintend, or enforce the peculiar treatment which each case
requires.</p>
<p>These conditional plans of superintendance must be allowed the
widest range, a range which no inexperienced person, still less
those who have false notions and impressions of the general
character of the insane, can possibly imagine, and for which no
acts or rules can give directions&mdash;How then can those
without knowledge and experience pretend to undertake such a
charge?&nbsp; Often we have only a choice of evils; and we must
be less anxious about the risk of accidents, our own credit, or
interest, than the cure or chances of good to be done.&nbsp; In
some cases absolute confinement would rapidly make the
patient&rsquo;s state worse, and we must give either real or
apparent liberty; a liberty which some would think imprudent. <a
name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a>&mdash;Yet I believe it is a fact, that
there are the fewest accidents where to appearance the greatest
liberty is <a name="page2_96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>given, <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a> harsh measures always increase the
evils which they would pretend to cure; but should one accident
occur under this mild system, the person adopting it would be
more blamed than he who had twenty accidents on the old
plan.&mdash;With the first system, it is often difficult to
persuade the friends of the patients to concur and
co-operate.&mdash;The family dispositions often render this
probable; nor can we always blame them: but he who undertakes
this charge, while he endeavours to persuade and conciliate as
far as possible, must in many cases feel himself called upon to
act with decision.&mdash;If he adopts the fears and prejudices of
others, then his system will become one of duplicity and tyranny,
exciting suspicion and vindictiveness, destructive alike of all
confidence and chance of cure; for unless we acquire the
confidence of the patient, no good can be done; mutual distrust
will end in absolute slavery and restraint to the patient, and in
<a name="page2_97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the
baneful habit of exercising the love of power on the part of
those who have the superintendance.&mdash;Hence the evils
apprehended by their friends as likely to arise out of the
patient&rsquo;s vindictive state, will be most effectually
established and increased.&nbsp; Instead of the calming effects
of a system of confidence and liberty, tranquillity, and peace,
this contrary system will continue to goad, irritate, and inflame
that part of the brain through which the mind, in this state, is
operating; and in pursuing such a course we are clearly guilty of
making that become fixed and permanent which otherwise might only
have been of very temporary duration.</p>
<p>While nothing is more certain than that, <i>in most</i> cases,
too sudden a return to old scenes and associations is extremely
dangerous, there are some others where I have known their
returning home at an early period, or even at some critical point
of convalescence, decidedly expedite and confirm their
cure:&mdash;when there appear evident reasons to augur favourably
of such a change, the trial should be made&mdash;we have only a
choice of evils, and we must endeavour to choose the least.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that many have, in an incipient state of
convalescence, been placed on parole of honor; first, they are
simply restricted to the garden, and afterwards the fields; and
if <a name="page2_98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>no
breach of confidence occurs, they are allowed a pass key to go
out and in when they please; and scarcely an instance has
occurred in which they have taken advantage of this privilege to
make their escape;&mdash;nor have they opened the doors to
others.&mdash;Those who escape are always those who are not so
trusted.</p>
<p>In some cases, I have known the convalescence of patients
confirmed, not merely by placing them on their parole of honor,
but by discharging them as patients, and inviting them to remain
and consider themselves as voluntary visitors.</p>
<p>It is astonishing what a stimulus all this is to others to
exert their <span class="GutSmall">SELF-CONTROL</span>, and to
behave more correctly; and still more so, on promising that on
their continuing correct for a given length of time, they shall
have these indulgences.&nbsp; But all this shall be more minutely
detailed under the Essay, <i>Moral Treatment</i>; when I shall
state the effects produced by always treating them as rational
beings, and allowing them, in proportion as they conduct
themselves more rationally, to have the privileges of, and as far
as possible to associate with, those who are so.&mdash;The
efforts which (in consequence of this principle being observed in
all our conduct towards them,) they constantly and anxiously make
to be considered rational, is an acquisition of prodigious moment
and when we see they possess <a name="page2_99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>it, we may pronounce it an excellent
symptom of the returning control of the will and
understanding.</p>
<p>This is in perfect accordance with the principle which
stimulates men, in society, to the useful or baneful exercise of
their understandings; and where it exists not, the mind will
rapidly sink into a state of apathy and indifference, <a
name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a> and I have no doubt, that many an
insane patient who feels that he no longer possesses this
stimulus to mental exertion and control, gives way to his foolish
thoughts, and still more so, when he finds it more easy to give
pleasure to others by their utterance than by endeavouring to
talk rationally: thus he acquires the habit of talking nonsense,
and hence this constitutes the character of many of the old
insane, who might, I believe, have otherwise been brought into a
more rational state. <a name="citation99b"></a><a
href="#footnote99b" class="citation">[99b]</a></p>
<p>We should never for our own ease encourage their delusions,
but tell them (when we do notice them at all, for silence is
often the most effectual reproof we can give; but when we are
obliged to notice them, we must honestly, but with charity, tell
them) what is false and dangerous, and which often has a good
effect; and if it does <a name="page2_100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>not cure, it restrains them from
talking on the subject of their delusions.</p>
<p>Many instances of cures on this principle are recorded, and
many more of my own I shall have to state when I come to Moral
Treatment.</p>
<p>Nothing can be worse than the common practice in public
institutions of allowing idle visitors to amuse themselves by
listening to, and of course encouraging, their conversation on
the subject of their individual insanity.&mdash;When we do notice
these delusions, and it must be seldom, it must be a very
important and grave matter; and we must exert all our eloquence,
and call forth the most overpowering arguments against the folly,
wickedness and direful consequences of encouraging these
delusions.</p>
<p>Dr. Crowther says, &ldquo;Mad persons are frequently capable
of being reasoned with; and it is sometimes in the power of the
physician to remove false impressions from the patient&rsquo;s
mind, by a well-directed reply and judicious
reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another patient imagined himself to be Jesus Christ; and in
proof of it showed me a scar he had in his side, which, he said,
had been occasioned by his having been pierced with a
spear.&mdash;I remonstrated with him on his assertion, and
remarked that our Saviour was wounded on the side opposite to
that be had indicated as the part wounded in
himself.&mdash;Convinced, and apparently ashamed at the
consciousness <a name="page2_101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>of the fallacy of his own reasoning, the patient
recoiled, hid himself under the bed clothes, and never reverted
to the impression under which he had previously laboured.</p>
<p>In many points the insane are accessible to reason; and at all
times and in all cases, as a rule, they should be treated as if
they were still reasonable beings.&mdash;Many are able to detect
ignorance, and can appreciate and respect knowledge: convicted
ignorance in a superintendent is fatal to his influence and
authority.&nbsp; To have the character of being intelligent, is
of great service.&mdash;Nothing impresses them with this
conviction so much, as proofs that you possess a key to unlock
their minds&mdash;that you have a perfect insight into the
peculiarities of each&mdash;can trace to its origin their insane
state,&mdash;the evil of extremes,&mdash;and more especially can
meet these with clear views of the truth of that which they have
perverted.&mdash;But all this still more requires that you are
not merely esteemed for talents, but also for goodness; then will
your arguments and example be like oil on the stormy waves,
calming turbulence and breathing peace even upon the victims of
passion, misery, and distraction.</p>
<p>All this will be acknowledged to be of great importance, when
it is considered that to call forth the exercise of self-control
is the most powerful moral means of recovering the lost equipoise
of mind.&nbsp; And that this may be done, <a
name="page2_102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>is
certain, for many have some power of self-control remaining, but
self-control in a state of misdirection.&nbsp; Numbers also have
many avenues of the mind still open, through which the
understanding may be stimulated into active exercise, and the
will turned into a right direction; and thus the same principle
may in many cases ultimately become the means of promoting their
restoration.</p>
<p>They generally know the points which others consider as proofs
of their insanity, and they should be made ashamed to display
them, but never directly irritated by a domineering opposition,
which would only rouse the bad passions and the spirit of
self-will to resist all means of counteraction. <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a>&mdash;Hence where these rules are
observed, it is often perceived that they will, on their first
entrance, keep their delusions out of sight; so much so, that it
is often for awhile difficult to discover their
insanity.&mdash;The early prospect also of their liberation often
induces this concealment: we must encourage this, but at the same
time, they should see that we have the power to perceive when it
is real, and when it is feigned for this purpose.&nbsp; When they
know we judge from the state of the inner, and not the outward,
man, the effect is wonderful.</p>
<p>It is not by any system of fear, as was once imagined, that
all this is to be done.&nbsp; <a name="page2_103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>This is a restraining power, which
must be seldom resorted to, and then only for specific and
temporary purposes, and never of long duration, otherwise the
mind will be thrown on itself, and feed on its notions.&nbsp; It
should never be used except conjoined with the suspension and
loss of sympathy which they have felt valuable, or for the sake
of others whose comforts are not to be sacrificed merely that
they may selfishly indulge in their absurd whims, and annoying
conduct, or in their erroneous views and vicious propensities:
for these reasons and purposes they must be separated, and if not
corrected by occasional separation, then they must be classed
with those whose comfort they cannot derange.&nbsp; They must
feel all this as the effect of their conduct, and that their
treatment depends on their behaviour; but any discipline or
change must never be made without a self-evident cause, and never
in the doing carry the air of tyranny, passion, or injustice.</p>
<p>All the principles applicable to the management of children,
are equally applicable to them.&nbsp; Though we must watch every
probable and threatening storm, we must not too eagerly
anticipate its approach&mdash;we must wait until it breaks out
and gives us an opportunity to justify the moral measures we
conceive are best calculated to produce a beneficial
influence.</p>
<p>As I have shown, we always endeavour most <a
name="page2_104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>sedulously (especially in the first instance begin
with) to act on this principle.&nbsp; We treat nearly all on
their arrival as if they came merely as visitors, and never alter
our conduct until they cease to behave as other people; and then
they cannot but blame themselves for their confinement or any
change of treatment that their conduct renders necessary, and
which must therefore be always sufficiently gross, even in their
own estimation, to justify the change.&nbsp; As classification
must be based on these moral views, there is necessarily included
in this Essay much that will fail to be more minutely considered
under the Essay, Moral Treatment, and much more that, it may at
present appear, I have, altogether omitted&mdash;such as the
obvious necessity of separating the vociferous, the dirty, the
epileptic, &amp;c. from the more rational, delicate, and
nervous.</p>
<p>One principle is very important, hereafter to be enforced,
which is, that some must be classed so that bad habits may be
prevented by the constant presence of others to call forth the
sense of shame to restrain them.</p>
<p>In fact, this plan of treatment should embrace every means
conducive to the cure of its objects, such as domestic quiet, and
the removal of every possible annoyance; and we are, above all
things, carefully to avoid every appearance of restraint, and to
adopt as little of the reality as is compatible with the security
of the violent, dangerous, <a name="page2_105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>and discontented, who must be
restrained, and if possible, without exciting or increasing their
diseased state.&nbsp; We must do every thing we can to soothe and
comfort the disappointed and melancholy, and diligently labour to
heal the broken-hearted; we must ascertain causes and effects,
and remove or counteract them; we must strive to correct or cure
wrong notions and impressions; we must cultivate and strengthen
better feelings and principles, and discourage all that is bad,
or allow it to die away for want of nourishment and exercise: for
such purposes the superintendant must be armed with medical and
moral means at all points, and be above selfish
considerations.&nbsp; To describe all this in detail, would be to
write volumes.&nbsp; It is evident then, that every variety of
suitable treatment should be adopted, according to the nature and
circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>All this is not to be done by mechanism, nor by the strictest
attention to any plan which some cold rules prescribe.&nbsp; Acts
of Parliament can never make these places what they ought to be,
and which it is of the first importance they should be; I mean
places for the voluntary seclusion of an exhausted mind, or
nervous invalid, and in every case as institutions not so much
for the confinement, as for the cure, of the insane.</p>
<p>Acts of Legislation may interfere with, cramp, <a
name="page2_106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>or
destroy the heaven-born and heaven-directed energies of the
mind.&mdash;It is dreadful to paralyze or destroy the spirit of
kindness, guided by experience and wisdom, by confining it to
rules which have merely for their object the prevention of evil,
and not the production of good!&nbsp; Those who legislate, should
be careful not to meddle in the province out of the reach of
human interference.&nbsp; By so doing, they may destroy, but they
can never give, the spirit by which alone good can be done.</p>
<p>The present system adds to the horrid association of these
houses, (and for which some of these houses may be accused of all
the blame,) and prevents them from becoming what I conceive would
be of the first importance,&mdash;I mean places for the voluntary
seclusion of an exhausted mind, or of a nervous invalid, which
would be of the first advantage to them, and would besides take
away the feeling of horror associated with such houses.&nbsp; It
is so in France.&nbsp; On the same principle, those who are sent
without their own concurrence, should never be treated as if they
were insane; the names &ldquo;Asylum,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Patient,&rdquo; &ldquo;Keeper,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Insanity,&rdquo; should never be heard among them; many
have been made worse by a contrary system of treatment; and I may
also mention that I am more and more convinced of the necessity
and efficacy of proper medical aid, and of course of a medical
man, or of one having acquired medical experience, <a
name="page2_107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>being
amongst them,&mdash;I repeat &ldquo;that no man ought to keep a
house for the care of the Insane, who does not make cure his
ruling motive for receiving, detaining, or discharging patients
from his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, the arguments are endless to prove every thing should
be done not to <i>increase</i>, <i>but diminish</i>, <i>the
horror</i> associated with these places.&nbsp; No act of
Parliament can give knowledge and principle, and good feelings;
and no Act should be made as a substitute for knowledge and
principle and good feelings, which every one in his specific
sphere should possess.&nbsp; No Act can give knowledge and
principle, but an Act can carry with it so much opprobrium, that
men of feeling and knowledge and principle, are deterred from
undertaking a department of the profession, which the law
supposes is only in the hands of base, unprincipled men.&nbsp;
The aim of the Legislature should be, to add to its
respectability, and to offer encouragement to those persons who
possess that knowledge and principle and have it in effectual
operation.</p>
<p>Mankind in general, are not made better by treatment that
shows our want of confidence in them.&nbsp; Though the mild
system is universally allowed to be, not only the most judicious,
but that which ought exclusively to be adopted, it will be seen
that it may be carried further than it has hitherto been done,
and much greater latitude given than we have yet conceived <a
name="page2_108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>possible,
and all this with the best possible results.</p>
<p>The principles of human nature, its moral and physical laws,
are illustrated among the insane, as well as sane; and if
revolutions and abuses of liberty in the world are the
unrestrained re-actions of the spirit of justice in men, against
those who have neglected or improperly restrained them; so, in
lunatic asylums, improper conduct towards the insane, or too much
restraint, has given rise to much of the misdirection and
irregularity in the display of their animal spirits; and be it
observed, that here, as well as in the world, those men are the
first to blame effects which they either themselves caused, or
which it was their province to foresee, prevent, or cure.</p>
<p>When the understanding is enlightened, or the higher feelings
cultivated, the impulses of our inferior feelings will assume a
better character, and be less liable to abuse.&nbsp; In asylums,
whatever mischief and malignity, are, by improper treatment
produced, the attendants place the whole to the account of their
insanity; very readily, and without any self-accusation, blaming,
and perhaps, severely punishing effects which they themselves
have either been the sole cause of, or which they might have
prevented.&nbsp; Nor can we wonder that such evils have existed,
if we consider how very difficult it is, to find combined
kindness, understanding, and practical <a
name="page2_109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>usefulness in those who can be procured to attend upon
them.&nbsp; Yet all this should exist in the character and
conduct of those who undertake their management.</p>
<p>The grand principle of treatment is, to avoid even the
appearance of unnecessary restraint, and to treat them with
apparent confidence: such a plan of procedure will almost
invariably excite their secret but proudest endeavours to
preserve and retain this confidence.&nbsp; There is a secret
power which holds the helm of the mind, and by its controlling
and moral influence guides it more effectually than any rude
restraints applied to the bones and muscles of the human
frame.</p>
<p>There is no influence so powerful as the sphere of a moral
influence.</p>
<p>It is painful to reflect on their former treatment; caged in
iron-gratings and exhibited for money!&nbsp; Treated as wild
beasts, they necessarily became like them, or worse!&nbsp; Devils
in revenge and evil, Satans in deceit and delusion!&nbsp; Or if
any portion of the man remained, think of the spirit writhing in
agony, or sinking with despair within them!&nbsp; All this, and
worse, in some despotic countries, even now exists; and in how
many places are they not still made to drink the bitter cup of
neglect and coldness, contempt and cruelty.&nbsp; Where do they
receive, as they ought, judiciously and constantly, the cordial
of sympathy and friendship?&nbsp; Where is <a
name="page2_110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>every
appearance of confinement and injurious association carefully
avoided, and every thing studied to make them feel at home, and
all this combined with medical attendance?&nbsp; Say not all this
is unnecessary; for if life, under any circumstances, cannot be
said to exist without some association of sympathy, it is certain
there are among the insane, cases of misery and wretchedness
which absolutely require for their cure, as well as their
comfort, all the moral kindness and medical attention we can
possibly give them.</p>
<p>It has been an universal complaint, that there is nothing
certain or fixed in the treatment of Insanity, and that it is
presumed it is not yet fully understood.&nbsp; I am of opinion
that no medical treatment in any case can be fixed as certain or
judicious unless we understood the origin and nature of disease;
and I have therefore devoted a considerable portion of this Essay
to the consideration of the correspondence which exists between
the causes and effects produced; and this I only consider as
preliminary to a more full and adequate investigation of causes
than I am aware has hitherto been made; but still, as preliminary
to this important subject, I shall, in my next Essay, first give
a general explanation of the origin and cause of disease, and
this in agreement with a principle which I conceive to be of
universal application.</p>
<h2><a name="page2_111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>APPENDIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THE</span><br />
ESSAY ON CLASSIFICATION.</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS.</h3>
<p>As in the foregoing Essay on Classification, I have several
times stated my objections against writers on Insanity selecting
only extreme cases, by which, I conceive, impressions of horror
against the Insane are increased to their prejudice; I shall,
therefore, for the <i>express purpose of exhibiting a fair
specimen</i> of the general character of the insane collectively,
in their worst and most revolting state, add, in an Appendix to
this Essay, about twenty of the oldest in age as well as in the
duration of the disease, and of course of the most incurable
cases, taken in regular rotation from the Register Book of the
oldest Asylum in the kingdom, excepting Bedlam; containing, at
the time the living characters were described, about one hundred
of the same class.&nbsp; Now though these are taken from among
those who had suffered all the brutalizing influence of the old
<a name="page2_112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>and
neglected system of treatment, yet they do not, as a whole,
exhibit so shocking a picture as previous popular prejudice would
imagine.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this truth, it is proper to state,
that they are incomparably a worse picture, than the same number
would make, taken with equal fidelity and correctness, from among
my own patients, admitted within the period of my own exclusive
superintendance,&mdash;this would, therefore, be much better
calculated to correct this injurious prejudice than that which I
<i>now</i> give for this purpose: but they are too recent to be
so introduced; yet as this would be a very striking contrast
illustrating the effects of different treatment, I shall be
prepared, should I live long enough for time to throw his dark
veil over their memory, with the same number of cases, taken and
described on the same principle.</p>
<p>I am the more anxious to do this at present, and fulfil this
my future intention, because it may perhaps be laid to my charge,
that in adducing cases illustrative of the principles contained
in this Essay on Classification, as well as those which, from
similar reasons, I may have hereafter to introduce, that I have
been guilty, and may be guilty of the same error of selecting
peculiar and extreme cases for my purpose; but I have been led
into this, from the feeling that circumstances had forced upon
me, <a name="page2_113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>however contrary to my previous intentions, something
of a defensive attitude.</p>
<p>These are the reasons which have been my inducements in adding
this Appendix; at the same time, to make the cases, in this naked
form, as interesting and as useful as possible, I have not only
drawn them with the most minute attention to truth, but to each I
have appended some appropriate and useful observation.</p>
<p>Previous, then, to my entering upon the important subject
mentioned at the end of this Essay, I shall now introduce these
cases as a faithful portraiture of the Insane.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 1.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1782; <i>aged</i>
76.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is nothing recorded of this
case, from which any correct information of the causes of the
malady, or of its nature, when admitted, or of its progress since
that period, can be drawn.&nbsp; Some of his relations are
insane, and many of them exceedingly eccentric.&nbsp; His friends
accuse some nurse of an improper application for the itch; yet,
notwithstanding this accusation, the disease was gradual in its
approach.&nbsp; He was gay when at Cambridge, and lost
considerable sums at the gaming table.&nbsp; There is reason to
believe that he had always been eccentric; and I have been told,
that in his youth, he was proverbially called the proud <a
name="page2_114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>and
polite man. <a name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a>&nbsp; Whether this be correct or not,
it is certain, that even now, though so little mind remains, he
is soonest roused and offended, though otherwise very
good-natured, by whatever questions his own importance.</p>
<p>Though, like many old men, he is fond of dozing away his time
in bed, he has, notwithstanding, seasons of greater animation,
when he seems more busily occupied with his own thoughts, often
talking to himself; repeating very correctly passages committed
to memory, probably forty years ago. <a
name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b"
class="citation">[114b]</a></p>
<p>At these periods, unless teased or vexed in the way already
stated, he is very good-natured and polite; and from his general
manners, and particularly in the modulation of his voice, he
still appears, in spite of the coarseness of his dress, <a
name="citation114c"></a><a href="#footnote114c"
class="citation">[114c]</a> the remains of a perfect
gentleman.&nbsp; At these times, he is, for the most part, very
happy, laughing and playing like a little child; <a
name="page2_115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>and his
very mischievous tricks&mdash;throwing stones, writing on the
walls, tearing his clothes in order to make some little fanciful
change and decoration of his dress, seem to be done rather as
resources for regular employment or amusement, than from any
malicious design or delight to be mischievous.</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION I.</h4>
<p>The slight changes or states of excitement described in this
case, are in my opinion, the mere fluctuation of his animal
spirits.&nbsp; I shall hereafter make further remarks (see ob. 5)
on this subject; and therefore, in the mean time, (to obviate the
objections which may be brought against this view,) I shall only
observe that when we consider the defective and uncontrolled
state of mind, <a name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a> in these old and incurable cases of
insanity, any change or increase of their animal spirits must,
though perhaps depending on causes which equally affect the sane,
display itself in them, in a very different manner.</p>
<h3><a name="page2_116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span><i>No.</i> 2.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1785; <i>aged</i>
67.</h3>
<p>There is no statement of this case on record, from which any
satisfactory information can be derived; nor have I been able to
obtain any account of his former life, or the nature or treatment
of his case.&nbsp; There has been nothing of late years to
distinguish his case from many old ones, whose minds have sunk
into the torpid state, except it be, which is scarcely worthy of
notice, that he has sometimes stood on his head to say his
prayers; sometimes spit in his pocket; and, when provoked, used
indecent language; otherwise his state of mind has not, for many
years, exhibited any observable alteration. <a
name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a>&nbsp; He will be best known when I
say, that he is singled out from the rest, as a little, timid,
old-looking man, uniformly sitting in a moping, creeping
posture.</p>

</a></p>
<h4>OBSERVATION II.</h4>
<p>This man is not more of an idiot than the one just described,
yet there is much less appearance of mind about him; but his
mental powers had not formerly been so much evolved <a
name="page2_117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>and
improved by education; and the mind, like the soil we tread on,
once properly broken up and cultivated, will, in defiance of
neglect, long retain traces of its former improved state.&nbsp;
Besides his want of early culture, being one of the middle class
of patients, he was wholly left without mental food or
exercise.&nbsp; There was, under the old system, a complete
sacrifice of the lowest, utter neglect of the middle, for the
sake of the higher class of patients; so that there was, with the
middle class, for the most part, no intellectual interest excited
by social converse and attention; nor, on the other hand, were
the malignant passions kept alive by brutal treatment: and hence
we now find amongst this class, the greatest proportion <a
name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117"
class="citation">[117]</a> of those whose minds have sunk into
torpid inactivity; and not so much because they are lost, but
because, from their want of excitement, they have too long
continued in this motionless state.&nbsp; It is true, that their
minds may, by the first attack, have undergone some great shock,
to derange or paralyse the more perfect performance of its
functions; but it is certain, that <a name="page2_118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>afterwards, no means were used to
resuscitate or feed the powers of the mind into renewed vigour
and activity.&nbsp; Few, even in the perfect possession of their
faculties, could bear to be excluded from the air and sunshine of
social life, and mingle only with beings in this melancholy
state, without feeling its effects upon them.&nbsp; We are not to
wonder, then, that those whose spirits have thus been prematurely
entombed within them, should have become almost as dead to
themselves and the world, as if the soul had already left
them.&nbsp; To prevent these consequences, I shall state all that
I think ought to be done, in another number of this work; which I
conceive is the most interesting part in the treatment of
insanity.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 3.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1787.</h3>
<p>There is nothing on record about this case, nor have I been
able to obtain any information of his previous history.</p>
<p>His mind is not in so defective or deranged a state, as
strangers and superficial observers are, from appearances, apt to
imagine.&nbsp; It is true, he seems stupid and churlish, always
silent unless spoken to, and then he answers with abruptness and
impatience, in a murmuring, grumbling, and almost unintelligible
manner, putting his words oddly together, like a child, <a
name="page2_119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>or one
unused, or too lazy, to articulate, and not that his answers are
absolutely irrational.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>He plays well at draughts and whist, but his doing so appears
to depend more on old habits, <a name="citation119a"></a><a
href="#footnote119a" class="citation">[119a]</a> than on the
present exercise of his faculties; which, though, as already
observed, they are not wholly lost, yet, from his torpor, age,
and the natural obstinacy of his disposition, he is disinclined
to exert himself out of his usual course: and though his constant
habits of employment and amusement in the house, make up for him
a considerable stock of felicity, and aid in procuring the degree
of health and spirits he enjoys, and the degree of mind he still
possesses; yet he is so extremely obstinate and tenacious of his
own mode of procedure, that any attempts to oppose him, will
arouse his temper into fits of angry passion. <a
name="citation119b"></a><a href="#footnote119b"
class="citation">[119b]</a></p>
<h4>OBSERVATION III.</h4>
<p>There is nothing particular to observe here, unless it be the
obvious remark, that from his age and confinement for such a
number of years, among beings who, for the most part, have no
commerce with right feelings and <a name="page2_120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>thoughts, it is wonderful that any
thing like powers of mind should still remain; or that he should,
excluded from the excitement and collision of the world, possess
any inclination to exercise them; but this is most probably owing
to the amusements and employments already stated; and for the
sake of drawing attention to this fact, have I been induced to
make any observation on this case.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 4.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1787.</h3>
<p>There is no statement of this case on record; but I have been
informed, it was the consequence of injury on the head.&nbsp; He
is a hopeless, and the most striking, case of idiotcy, at present
in the house: a poor, simple, innocent, dangling, pouting,
starved-looking creature, with a bluish red nose, and his head
hanging forwards, saliva running over his falling
lip&mdash;generally moving about to gratify his childish
curiosity.&nbsp; Yet, as little mind as there is about him, still
even he has fluctuations of the animal spirits: sometimes he is
depressed and miserable; at other times he is animated and
happy.&nbsp; When depressed, he for the most part repeats, in a
feeble, plaintive tone,&mdash;&ldquo;poor creature.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When animated and happy, he will throw his arms about in a most
laughable manner, to the great amusement of other patients; so
much <a name="page2_121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>so, that it is impossible to convey any conception of
it, unless it be by making an old person try to imitate the
frisky movements of an infant&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; These
exhibitions are of rare occurrence.&nbsp; He will mumble over a
tune very correctly, <a name="citation121a"></a><a
href="#footnote121a" class="citation">[121a]</a> but has seldom
any words.&nbsp; He is pleased with striking objects,
particularly such as have glaring colours about them; and women,
or their dress, arrest his attention. <a
name="citation121b"></a><a href="#footnote121b"
class="citation">[121b]</a></p>

</a></p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 5.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1791.</h3>
<p>There is likewise no statement of this case on record, from
which any satisfactory information can be drawn.</p>
<p>His personal appearance, and moping manners, were so very like
the case described, No. 2, that it was common for those in the
house to mistake the one for the other.&nbsp; He, like many other
old and incurable cases, sat in a solitary, half-dozing state,
his head reclining against the fire-guard, and seemed, when
roused, like one who wakened out of his sleep unrefreshed.&nbsp;
He was most remarkable for his extreme good <a
name="page2_122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>nature,
and excellent disposition. <a name="citation122a"></a><a
href="#footnote122a" class="citation">[122a]</a>&nbsp; When on
his death-bed, his gratitude and affection to his attendant (who
was certainly an excellent nurse) were very pleasing.&nbsp; He
had been long sinking from disease of the lungs, constantly
coughing and spitting; and, latterly, purulent matter, in a very
great quantity.&nbsp; He died on the 13th April, 1822.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 6.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1791.</h3>
<p>There is no statement of his case, and I have not been able to
collect much information about him.&nbsp; It is said, he received
a severe wound, and the mark remains on the upper back part of
his head. <a name="citation122b"></a><a href="#footnote122b"
class="citation">[122b]</a>&nbsp; Report says, that he fancied
himself in love with a farmer&rsquo;s daughter, and walked whole
nights before her father&rsquo;s door, without the slightest
previous acquaintance with the object of his choice.&nbsp; This
would seem rather the effect than the cause&mdash;a common
mistake; they are constantly confounded together, or mistaken for
each other.&nbsp; It is certain, that his neighbours were obliged
to send him to a place of confinement, for this <a
name="page2_123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>reason&mdash;whenever he saw any cattle in a poor
pasture, he, from the impulse of his nature, invariably removed
them into a better.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p122b.jpg">
<img alt=
"No. 6 page 122"
title=
"No. 6 page 122"
 src="images/p122s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>He is well known through the house, and even through the town;
and on this account, I feel some hesitation and difficulty in
attempting to describe his case.</p>
<p>He is a general favourite, and every one meets him, and he
meets every one, with a welcome, good-natured smile, and he
appears so much pleased to entertain them with some extraordinary
ridiculous tale, that a stranger would suppose he talked
absurdly, on purpose to amuse him. <a name="citation123"></a><a
href="#footnote123" class="citation">[123]</a>&nbsp;
Notwithstanding all his talk, he is most industrious, and the
most useful man in the house; does his work most correctly and
systematically; delights in going upon errands amongst his
acquaintances in town, always delivering the messages properly;
and the moment he has done so, begins with his own strange
nonsense, to the great delight of his hearers.&nbsp; His spirits
are always even, he has regular exercise, and his good nature is
proverbial; nothing vexes him, unless it be, threatening that
another shall be employed instead of <a
name="page2_124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>him, to
do the work he has been in the habit of doing for his favourites
in the house.&mdash;His delight is, night or day, to be of
service to others, so that his energies are wholly and regularly
expended in being useful, making himself happy, and pleasing all
who come near him.</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION IV.</h4>
<p>Probably his astonishing correctness in delivering messages,
&amp;c., in the midst of so much apparent confusion of mind, may
be thus explained:&mdash;From the pre-eminence of his good
nature, the desire to please still retains some hold over the
rest of his faculties, and, perhaps, also over the extreme
extravagance of his conversation, which may arise from the same
cause.&nbsp; We have only to imagine, that his erroneous tales
were, in the first instance, listened to (a fact, this, of
injudicious treatment, which is too common,) with seeming assent
and delight, until he found, from daily experience, that to
please others, he had only to encourage his foolish thoughts, and
utter them, and then the habit would insensibly grow upon him,
until it became inveterate; and hence is explained another
singularity about him,&mdash;that in his present manner of
talking, it appears as if he were talking absurdly for the very
purpose of amusing others.&nbsp; It is now, however, certain,
that <a name="page2_125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>it would be not only useless, but cruel, to try, by
direct means, to prevent it.&nbsp; Yet, though we are not to
tease and vex him, by contradiction, or by refusing to listen to
his tales; it ought to be remembered, that in this and all other
cases, we ought never, on any account, to violate the truth.</p>
<p>Though we should never forget to exercise prudence, we must be
careful that truth still presides at the helm, otherwise it may
degenerate into cunning; then what we call prudence, is vicious
and mischievous; and yet, men persuade themselves while doing so,
that some evil is avoided, or some good is secured.&nbsp; No
power of the mind should ever be so exercised, as to require the
suspension or sacrifice of another.&nbsp; To exercise every
virtue in its place, and to give to each &ldquo;its relative and
appropriate share,&rdquo; is the perfection at which we should
ever aim.&nbsp; This principle, as it is the best prevention, so
also it is the best remedy in the cure, of insanity.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 7.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1792.</h3>
<p>No statement of this case, from which any information can be
drawn: it is, however, certain, that insanity is in the
family.</p>
<p>Among the old cases, we have none that arrests the attention
of strangers so much as <a name="page2_126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>this, and he never fails to attract
the gaze of idle curiosity.&nbsp; His habits of circumgyration,
with sudden stops and starts,&mdash;his strange air of
abstractedness, a sort of excogitative look, apparently puzzled
to find something out,&mdash;odd way of talking to himself, as if
he himself were some other person, saying, &ldquo;what a noise
the fellow makes,&rdquo; &ldquo;I think the fellow&rsquo;s a
fool,&rdquo; and striking his face in apparent
anger,&mdash;strange mode of mentioning names once familiar to
him,&mdash;putting a question,&mdash;seeming to listen, and
giving an answer quite foreign to it, are most striking, and such
as no descriptive powers can enable another to conceive, without
seeing him.&nbsp; When noticed or teased, and sometimes without,
he strikes and scratches, in a way that would seem either like a
bad habit that had been taught him; or half frolic and half
mischief, and which, by provocation, becomes more serious;
otherwise, he is sensible of kind treatment; and now, from
increasing age, and perhaps from being, on the whole, less
teased, he exhibits less of this disposition.&nbsp; This state of
continued exertion and restlessness, is followed by a
proportional degree of depression, and, after being recruited by
sleep, returns.&nbsp; These regular alternate states of
excitement and restlessness, of depression and sleep, last each
for several days, and this for many years&rsquo; duration.&nbsp;
When most excited, he <a name="page2_127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>makes a strange loud singing noise,
stamps with his feet, strikes his head and face, and exhibits
various incommunicable indications of surprise, pleasure, or
anger, just as his mind happens to be agitated, like one in a
dream, with the floating and shattered images of times gone by,
passing confusedly through his mind.</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION V.</h4>
<p>I am unable to ascertain, from any traditionary treatment of
this case, whether the habit of gyration originated in some
diseased imagination; or was merely, as I believe is more
frequently the case, a habit which he had acquired from long
confinement in a small space.&nbsp; This habit was common in
former times, when they were confined in cells, and had no airing
grounds; and yet some writers, without attending to this
circumstance, have called it a symptom common to insanity! in
this way, many things have been called symptoms, which have been,
in fact, indications of improper treatment.&nbsp; The peculiar
states of excitement and depression, so striking in this case,
and which is so common with the old insane, as to have been
called the chronic type of the incurable, I shall endeavour to
show, how, in many instances, it may be explained on a different
principle.</p>
<p>Dr. Halloran, in his practical observations <a
name="page2_128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>on
Insanity, says,&mdash;&ldquo;Chronic insanity is that form of the
disease, which, having passed through the acute and convalescent
stages, has assumed the more permanent character, and is known by
the frequent exacerbation of the original accession; also,
finally, under circumstances of less violence, and with symptoms
subacute in relation to the primary affection.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
adds,&mdash;&ldquo;There are few Practioners of the most ordinary
discernment, who will not feel themselves disposed to acknowledge
that cases of insanity, precisely of this form, compose the
greater majority of those committed to their care.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He further says,&mdash;&ldquo;That these paroxysms are for the
most part periodical in their approach; for though of shorter
duration, they continue pertinaciously unyielding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the observations which I have to suggest, it will be
seen, that I conceive in some instances, in opposition to Dr.
Halloran, and some others, that the chronic type, or the
paroxysms of some of the permanently insane, are merely an
exhibition of the irregular increase in the stock of their animal
spirits, and not an exacerbation or new accession of the disease:
and that even, in many cases, where the alternating changes of
excitement and depression are most striking, I believe they first
originated in those fluctuations of the animal spirits, common to
all of us; in some <a name="page2_129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>instances, it is true, (and the case
last described is one,) singularly modified, not merely by the
state of mental alienation, but by circumstances connected with
their confinement.&nbsp; Before, however, I endeavour to explain
these singular modifications, it appears necessary to premise
some observations on one of the causes which conspires to produce
them, which cause is connected with the atmosphere.</p>
<p>But as I intend to devote an Essay on Atmospheric influence, I
shall content myself with asserting, in the mean time, that there
is some common cause, or causes, assigned either to atmospherical
changes, or co-ordinate with these changes, affecting the animal
spirits of the sane and the insane&mdash;of the healthy and
diseased, (in all, the manifestation is according to individual
state,) is generally, and indeed, I might perhaps say,
universally admitted, that the fact will require no further
proof, either to introduce or confirm its truth.&nbsp; There is
then a certain periodicity in the excitement and depression of
our spirits, as well as in all our diseases, mental or corporeal,
so absolutely certain, that it must be the conjoined effect of
some order in the operations of nature, and cannot be explained
on the principle of accidental or apparent coincidence, by which
credulous and superstitious minds are often deceived.</p>
<p><a name="page2_130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Though the artificial habits and constitutions of men
must modify these influences, we still, notwithstanding, often
perceive the effects are simultaneous in time, and sometimes that
they preserve the same type, and as such artificial modifications
do not exist in the same degree in the animal creation,
especially in those undomesticated, on the contrary, these
influences are so uniform on them, that the signs and symptoms of
their presence are the barometers of rural life, it follows that
these very modifications in men, when rightly perceived, are
additional proofs of their being the effects of one cause.</p>
<p>Even in man the influence of seasons, climate, and all violent
atmospherical changes, are so striking as to be admitted by all,
because they are so powerful as to overwhelm all artificial
counteracting modifications; but, as it regards all common and
minor influences, even when the effect on the mass are coincident
in time, they are in individuals so modified by the specific
habits, the state of the health, and the peculiar state of mind,
that they become so much disguised, and of course so much less
obvious to common observation, that even some medical men will
deny atmospherical influences altogether when held forth as
objects of scientific investigation, and ridicule as fanciful the
man who maintains a firm and well-grounded <a
name="page2_131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>philosophical faith in them; this is most inconsistent,
and is like admitting a clock may mark hours, but cannot mark
minutes as they pass.&mdash;It is the child who has just
discovered the use of the hour, but not of the minute hand, of a
time-piece.</p>
<p>The philosopher knows that the unobserved and silent influence
is the most important, and that the striking results are the mere
indexes of its secret movements.</p>
<p>Let ignorance pretend to admire these striking results, and
laugh at him who is anxious to discover the cause which produces
them; he has incomparably more interest and pleasure, his eyes
more open, and his understanding more exercised in these common
facts, than other men, while yet he deems them as nothing
compared to the end they serve; they are indeed interesting in
themselves, but to him they are most interesting, because he
considers them the means, but still only as the means, by which
he obtains the noblest object which the light of his reason can
discover&mdash;the discovery of those principles, or of that
order of operation of the cause which produces them.</p>
<p>Medical libraries are full of books on the influence of
seasons and climate, miasmata, malaria, and other local causes of
disease: and they admit also that the influences of all these are
such, that almost all diseases common <a
name="page2_132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>to man
will exhibit altered and corresponding symptoms under these
varying circumstances, proving they participate in, and are
conjoined (or &ldquo;tinged as it were,&rdquo; as it is said by
some,) with them.</p>
<p>All this, however, I leave for the Essay on the Atmosphere,
but I mention these facts and observations in the mean time for
the sake of this argument, that if all these modifications are
admitted to exist among the sane, how much more strikingly must
the peculiar circumstances, the singular habits, and the altered
state of mind of the insane, modify the effects of this
influence:&mdash;so strikingly, that I have no doubt, from these
causes, may be explained the very singular exhibitions in this
last-mentioned case.&nbsp; Where the particular state of mind,
and the peculiar circumstances connected with his confinement,
have superinduced in the system the irregular accumulation and
expenditure of the nervous energy, so that, though the increase
of the animal spirits was, in the first instance, the common
effect of a cause operating in and through all, every
where,&mdash;yet, operating through, and modified by, the
peculiarities connected with his case, has in time produced in
him, as well as in a less striking degree in others, and in fact,
in many, though certainly not in all cases of insanity, effects
so very singular and striking.</p>
<p><a name="page2_133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>Again, these changes of the atmosphere, which produce
these effects on the sane, seem, on the insane, in many cases, to
be wholly expended in producing fluctuations on the animal
spirits (not in bodily effects,) so expended, as if this increase
of the vital energies were neither subject to the usual laws of
corporeal nor intellectual distribution.&nbsp; These insane,
consequently, are less subject to disease from these causes, as
if they, no longer responsible, paid not, therefore, the price of
the use and abuse of the energies continually imparted to
all.&nbsp; It is true, that the life they lead, not only removes
them from many causes of disease, but the very nature of their
diseased state, also, renders the mind more susceptible of
impressions, for, beside their excited state, by being shut out
from the world, they necessarily give to trifles all the
importance of weightier matters, and thus it is, that by their
being the victims of mental excitement, <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a> which is every where a protection
against prevailing diseases, they are not so liable to be
attacked by the prevailing epidemics. <a
name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b"
class="citation">[133b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page2_134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>Whatever influences prevail externally, they must in
all cases, sane and insane, be counteracted and modified by
internal influences.</p>
<p>But to enter upon this investigation is not at present my
intention, therefore I shall not now examine the question,
whether the epidemics of different times, and the character of
all diseases, which always partake, more or less, of the
prevailing epidemic, can be <i>wholly</i> <a
name="citation134"></a><a href="#footnote134"
class="citation">[134]</a> explained as being caused by some
difference in the prevailing state of the weather.&nbsp; I shall
only remark that it is certain such seasons and states of the
weather are equally fruitful in the production of insanity and in
the excitement of those already insane.&nbsp; Yet, from these
internal mental or moral influences, it is evident that neither
insanity nor epidemic diseases can prevail exactly in proportion
to the state of the weather, unless it could be proved there
always existed a correspondence between the state of the weather
and the moral and physical susceptibilities or predisposition of
the persons exposed to its influence.</p>
<p>At the same time I assert that our moral state has more to do
with disease, either directly or indirectly, than is generally
credited, yet these moral causes are necessarily every where
physical in their operation, so that the assertion <a
name="page2_135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>that our
physical corresponds with our moral state, and what we call
physical causes are the effects of this state, need not alarm us,
in fact, the interesting truth is now demonstrated, <a
name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a> that health and longevity correspond
with our moral state, (though this is true as a general
principle, there are many real and apparent exceptions,) in fact,
natural and moral effects co-operate, just as the circulation
depends on the nervous energy, so the nervous energy depends
greatly on our mental condition.</p>
<p>Whether, however, the causes of diseases are more of a mental
or corporeal character, is not now the question to decide.</p>
<p>For though in the Essay I propose to give on atmospheric
influence, I shall endeavour to point out the various causes
which may give rise to an irregular display of the spirits of the
insane, I am far, however, from denying, that there are alternate
states of excitement and depression, of better and worse days,
which we may not be able to trace to these causes, but which may
depend on principles similar to other physical intermittents,
just as we have periodical head-aches, having their accession and
intermission most frequently every alternate day, and yet, even
in these cases, I have been able to discover the origin of these
head-aches, as <a name="page2_136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>was my own case, to alternate sleepless and distressing
nights.&nbsp; Looking at these periodical exacerbations of
insanity, without tracing them up to their first causes, they
seem like the operation of some disturbing cause, requiring a
given time to arrive at their crisis, or to produce the effect,
and when produced, to subside again, and this cause, thus viewed
in its less remote operation, seems altogether of a physical
nature.&nbsp; But this periodicity, which I also advocate, will
be more fully examined in the third section of the Essay on
Atmospheric Influence, in which some observations will be
ventured on lunar influence.</p>
<p>Let the reader in the mean time take it for granted that such
an influence exists; we shall then be able to examine the
modifying influence which the peculiar state of the mind, in
each, among the insane, must have over their manner of exhibiting
these alterations in their animal spirits, especially among the
old incurable cases, labouring, as it has been said, under the
chronic form of insanity.</p>
<p>Often, after the first attack, their minds are left in an
imperfect state; yet, notwithstanding this inability to discharge
the functions of mind properly, they generally retain their
physical energies, enjoy vigorous health, and, of course, the
flow of their animal spirits dependent thereon, is more likely to
be improved than <a name="page2_137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>otherwise; with respect to mind, however, they not
merely want volition, and the common motives and principles of
control over themselves, but there have been circumstances
connected with their confinement, which, co-operating with the
excitement, (the cause of which I shall hereafter attempt to
explain,) have formed in the system regular periodical returns of
these states; so that, at these periods, they not only, more
obviously, exhibit these changes in their spirits, and, of
course, display without disguise, their peculiarities of mind, as
children do, and sometimes as even men do, when warmed with
friendship, or with wine; but they also do so in a higher degree,
and, of course, with all their latent imperfections of mind, in a
much more striking manner; they then &ldquo;show
themselves,&rdquo; their peculiar character and defects; nor
should this explanation of the periodical return of these states
of excitement, from the above-mentioned co-operating causes,
surprise us; we may every day witness the operation of the same
principle, among men possessed of reason.</p>
<p>We all know, whoever gratifies any passion, or accustoms the
system to any artificial stimulus, at stated periods, invariably
finds the difficulty of resisting this passion, and his
inclination for this stimulus greatest, at the usual period of
gratification: and so it is with the <a
name="page2_138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>expenditure of animation; in fact, nothing is more
certain, than that both mind and body become the slave of those
customs, which the manner of our living, and moral conduct, and
the circumstances through which we have passed, have fastened
around us.&nbsp; Now, as the circumstances and treatment of the
insane, have hitherto been different from common life, (the
object ought to be, in the treatment of the insane, to resemble
common life as much as possible;) and as they are without control
over themselves, their mode of displaying their more animated
state, must be as different from the civilized man, as the
civilized man is from the savage.&nbsp; If, then, habits of
civilization may be called a second nature, here it may be said,
that a third has been superinduced.</p>
<p>From these circumstances and states of mind, it appears, that,
instead of their stock of animal spirits being expended, under
the guidance of a moral agency, and regularly diffused over their
existence, they are subject to mere physical influence, and
become the sport of every eddying wind that blows; and therefore
we find every possible variety and irregularity
exhibited.&mdash;A perfect contrast to that of the good and wise
man, if such a one can be found, whose balance of mind is
preserved, whose spirits are tranquil and even, who enjoys
perpetual <a name="page2_139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>sunshine within, and diffuses peace and serenity around
him.</p>
<p>Thus, because when their spirits are buoyant, they strangely
exhibit their inherent defects of mind, it has in many instances
been mistaken for an exacerbation or a returning accession of the
disease, and called the chronic type of old incurable cases.</p>
<p>It further appears, that this view is correct, from the fact,
that if their manner of talking and acting, in expending their
increased flow of spirits, is improperly encouraged or
exasperated, then we find their individual and latent defects
become more obvious; but with proper treatment, they gradually
die away: in fact, these appearances are more or less
perceptible, in a great measure, according to the spirit and
conduct of the superintendant; and even, under him, to that of
their respective attendants.&nbsp; Of this, I could give some
striking illustrations.&nbsp; It is astonishing how much the
increased flow of the spirits will be dark, gloomy, and
vindictive; or light, cheerful, and full of kindliness; just as
we by our treatment excite and keep alive one part of the mind or
another.&nbsp; The same principle might be illustrated also, on a
larger scale, by surveying the conduct of different parties and
governments in the world; and on a smaller scale we see every one
in authority, a magistrate, a gentleman, a minister, <a
name="page2_140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>a pastor,
the captain of a ship, and a parent, stamp their character on the
sphere in which they move.</p>
<p>Were it the place, nothing could be more instructive than
examples to demonstrate the correctness of these
observations.</p>
<p>The preceding case, I consider, is one of these
examples.&nbsp; I have said, that for the most part, these states
of excitement and depression, are merely an irregular exhibition
in the accumulation and expenditure of the animal spirits, and
not always to be considered, according to Dr. Halloran&rsquo;s
view, as the remains of the disease in the state of a returning
paroxysm, and that which characterises the permanently insane;
but that this originated in, and depended on, causes which
equally affect the animal spirits of the sane and insane, with
this difference, that in the insane, as in this case, they are
modified by the peculiar state of mind, and the sort of treatment
they have received.</p>
<p>Grant that, from the state of his mind, any little increase of
animation would resemble, in a slight degree, that which he now
exhibits, then I am, by the help of facts, in this and some other
cases of a similar nature, justified in saying, that I have been
able to trace the process and progress of these changes, from
small beginnings to their present state.&nbsp; I <a
name="page2_141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>know,
from the best information, that his manner and appearance were,
when excited, so laughable and striking, that the attendants and
their friends, from want of proper feeling, or perhaps mere
thoughtlessness, actually made him a source of private sport and
amusement, and thus increased his excited state, which, in the
course of time, assumed its present peculiar and amusing form. <a
name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a></p>
<p>A minute detail of all these things, together with unnecessary
and injudicious confinement, I am certain, would prove all
this.</p>
<p>In many cases, and especially in the last, I have been able to
trace, as I have already said, the process and progress of these
changes, from small beginnings to their present state.&nbsp; In
some cases, any little increase of animation gave rise to manners
and conversation, which were extremely amusing, and such as
tempted silly and unthinking people, as well as the other
patients, to encourage by listening or assenting too much to
them, or to exasperate by wantonly making them a source of sport
and amusement; conduct which cannot be too strongly deprecated,
especially during the critical period of their convalescence.</p>
<p><a name="page2_142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>In
most instances, however, it must be allowed, that among these old
incurable cases, <a name="citation142"></a><a href="#footnote142"
class="citation">[142]</a> the most powerful exciting causes are
within them.&nbsp; When their minds are at all irradiated,
striking ideas, and scenes of the past, cross their imaginations;
they are further excited by them; and in proportion as the system
is excited, these ideas are themselves more powerfully awakened;
they have no clear consciousness nor control over themselves; and
this dreaming state of their minds, to them all reality, is
sometimes as cheering as the dreams of hope can make it, and at
other times as horrible as the night-mare! and thus they are
wrought up into the most excited or exasperated state.&nbsp; In
some cases, especially the foregoing, this goes on until they are
worn out, when they require a corresponding portion of time to
renew their vital energies; and thus cause and effect mutually
produce each other.&nbsp; These alternate states of excitement
and depression, being often repeated, they gradually increase in
strength and duration; and thus it is in some few cases, and
especially those similar to the last, we find, that their spirits
are not expended and renewed, as ours are, once in twenty-four
hours, because these changes have become the habitudes of their
nature, so that their system becomes governed by new laws of <a
name="page2_143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>action.&nbsp; It is very singular that those most
liable to extremes, are most predisposed to insanity, and in its
more confirmed stage to this periodicity of excitement and
depression.</p>
<p>I have already noticed, <a name="citation143"></a><a
href="#footnote143" class="citation">[143]</a> that the
excitement of the depressing and exhilarating passions
alternately, is the most striking characteristic of the old
insane,&mdash;so striking that the general division of insanity
is intomania and melancholia; a division, however, which is
altogether unphilosophical, as the mania and melancholia are not
any abstract difference in the cause of the disease itself, but
merely the results of the over-active nervous energy operating in
different directions&mdash;at one time on the depressing, another
on the exhilarating passions; this indeed is the case, more or
less, with all those who preserve not this mental equilibrium,
but who act more from the impulse of their feelings and passions
than the cold calculations of reason, and the rigid restraints of
principle.&nbsp; To what extremes are the passions of the human
mind liable, when neither the true light of the understanding nor
any right sense of justice guide them!&nbsp; We see this in
ignorant and unprincipled individuals, who suddenly rush out of
their thraldom and pupilage into liberty and licensciousness; we
see the same thing exhibited by <a name="page2_144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>agitated and wicked masses, as in
the French Revolution, when the moral, like the physical ocean,
is let loose from its order and control, and heaves its
tumultuous waves of passion, as if by an earthquake, from one
overwhelming extreme to another.</p>
<p>When then, as in the insane, all the restraining powers of the
mind are lost, can we wonder that the mental energies should be
subject to accidental and baneful influences? that they should
impetuously rush with fearful, because with unguided force, into
the most opposite and direful extremes?&nbsp; These extremes,
however, always correspond to the individual peculiarity of mind,
and the nature of the exciting causes, which exciting causes
often exist internally long before they become externally
evident; thus gradually forming ruts in those weak or soft parts
of the mind, as it were, in which their feelings are naturally
more apt to run; and thus they acquire the increasing facility
and strength of habit, in operating in one direction rather than
another, until they become irresistible: or in other words, until
the understanding has no longer the power to extricate the mind
from their influence.&mdash;Body and mind have been allowed
conjointly and reciprocally to produce and increase these
effects.&nbsp; The effects are first, disordered action; next,
inflamed and diseased organization <a name="page2_145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>of the brain, as well as this
disordered action being continually strengthened by a daily
increase in the power of mental association, &ldquo;calling forth
an increased susceptibility to the action of certain exciting
causes;&rdquo; and so far I agree with Dr. Halloran, that a
something like the original &ldquo;accession of the
disease,&rdquo; more readily takes place. <a
name="citation145a"></a><a href="#footnote145a"
class="citation">[145a]</a></p>
<p>I have said, <a name="citation145b"></a><a
href="#footnote145b" class="citation">[145b]</a> that in cases of
permanent insanity, the alternations into these opposite mental
states occur most frequently among persons whose previous
character was marked by extremes,&mdash;who were easily excited,
and as easily depressed, either by their hopes, their fears,
their anger, or their affections.&nbsp; And I have often had
occasion to hear these remarks on their admission; and further,
that they could not bear stimulants, especially ardent spirits;
and that there was insanity decidedly developed during their
worst paroxysms of intoxication.</p>
<p>In fact, the history of their lives, at least of some of them,
was that of comedy and tragedy, perpetually prophesying and
exhibiting a threatening prelude of their present more awful
state; <a name="page2_146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>more awful in appearance, because it has now become
bereft of its former lucid interludes; which lucid interludes
had, possibly for some time, been externally maintained only by
the mere power of external moral influences, long after the
internal control had ceased to preside over the mental
operations.</p>
<p>We call it insanity when external restraints are broken down
and disregarded; we cannot decide how long absurd and delusive
feelings and notions have monopolized all the operations of the
little world within.&nbsp; I shall have occasion hereafter to
adduce the history of many cases which will serve to illustrate
the truth of these views.&nbsp; I may briefly mention, that they
occur most frequently in those families where such a constant
April atmosphere exists: and, as a further argument it may be
stated, that a greater proportion of victims to these causes
occur among the women than among the men; and in the male sex we
find they are those of a more feminine character, or those whose
feelings naturally predominate over their understandings.</p>
<p>Thus children who resemble their parents, through the spirit
in which they were conceived and brought forth, become still more
like them by example and education; and hence the very important
fact, that the greater number of those who lose the power over
their own <a name="page2_147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>minds, are from among those who have been unaccustomed
at an early stage of their existence to exercise a salutary
control over their feelings and habits; and of those especially
such as naturally possess strong animal and sentimental
feelings.&nbsp; Hence it is said, &ldquo;that of all the causes
of mental derangement termed moral causes, perhaps the greatest
number may be traced to the error of early education.&rdquo; <a
name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147"
class="citation">[147]</a>&nbsp; Thus, as I have already
remarked, an only child, or the youngest, (who has often as much
exclusive attachment as an only child, because he is the son of
old age, or is young when the rest cease to be children; or may
be the only one left at home,) are numerous amongst the
insane.</p>
<p>Again, in confirmation of the same argument, we may here
remark, that the greatest number of those who become insane,
become so between the ages of thirty and forty,&mdash;a period
when establishments are formed, and habits have been strengthened
by time, while the feelings yet retain all their energy and
susceptibility of action.&nbsp; Thus we can conceive why reverses
and disappointments should then have the most fatal and
overwhelming influence.&mdash;Still less need we wonder that this
should happen to those whose animal propensities and sentimental
feelings have been exclusively cultivated, as they then find that
if understanding and principle are insufficient <a
name="page2_148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>to
restrain them, the claims of society forbid their
gratification.&nbsp; Hence the conflict becomes dreadful and
dangerous, confounding and overturning the balance of the
mind.&nbsp; Even without this, bad passions, disjointed and
exclusive habits of feeling and thinking can hardly go on
progressively increasing to this age, without becoming so
irresistible as to threaten to destroy and swallow up in their
vortex all that remains of the man within them.&nbsp; Such is a
true and beautiful description that Johnson has given of
Imlac&rsquo;s insanity in his Rasselas.&nbsp; Any passion or
propensity of our souls, when improperly indulged and carried to
excess, is an abnegation of reason; and in saying this, we give a
true definition of insanity, however startling this wide
application may appear.</p>
<p>What is the most obvious history of most cases?&mdash;Thoughts
and feelings are indulged on any given point, to the detriment or
suppression of others which might draw us from this dangerous and
exclusive habit of the mind; till at last we become incapable of
resisting any other train of thought, and feeling, and action;
&ldquo;they are at first imperious, and at last
despotic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When and how are all these evils to be best prevented?&nbsp;
We answer, in the preliminary stage of our existence.&nbsp; We
shall revert to this important subject in an essay on the primary
<a name="page2_149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>principles of education; and shall only now remark,
that where we perceive a soil full of the seeds of all these
evils, we can expect only corresponding fruits?&nbsp; We shall
conclude these remarks by directing the reader to look to the
soil where these evils exist: we do this, because it exhibits the
truth of the principle for which we are contending.</p>
<p>We see, in the history of families, that the extremes of
heartless tyranny on the one hand, and the foolish fondness of
blind affection on the other, engender soils equally favourable
to the production of these terrible fruits to which we allude:
still more so is this the case where these extremes exist in the
same family.</p>
<p>Many are the married persons who waste their lives in
inordinately and alternately hating and loving each other.&nbsp;
From small beginnings, breezes arise and gather into storms; at
last, exhausted by their violence, they subside, and for a while
love returns, and all its ardent affection.&nbsp; Such is the
brief but sad history of many a matrimonial union,&mdash;but who
can describe its baneful influence?&mdash;how much evil and
misery are propagated! how much reason and principle, health and
happiness, reputation and prosperity, are sacrificed in those
families, whose parents thus suffer reason and understanding to
be the victims of these opposite and alternate mental states!</p>
<p><a name="page2_150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Of
which states, such as become insane, are but the caricature
samples of the hereditary family infirmities, and the actual
habits of their lives; and perhaps this may happen to one less a
hypocrite than the rest, because in such a one, the external and
internal become more easily and readily in fixed and permanent
correspondence.&nbsp; It is natural, therefore, to expect that
this same character will be exhibited still more conspicuously
after the understanding has altogether ceased to perform its
godlike attribute of rightly using the light of pure reason so as
to enthrone and support that one grand ruling principle to which
the whole mind should be obedient and subordinate.</p>
<p>I have been the more particular in making these observations,
because I conceive they may be useful in a medical point of
view.&nbsp; They may prevent us from mistaking the simple, though
modified, changes of the natural ebb and flow of our animal
spirits, for an exacerbation or new accession of
insanity,&mdash;and thus warn us from treating the patient with
unnecessary restraint, as though he were suffering from a new
attack, and from blindly endeavouring to cure a hopeless case by
the wanton administration of strong and deleterious drugs, which
in most instances would destroy health, as well as the remnant of
the faculties: &ldquo;In the diseases of the mind, as well as in
all other ailments, it is <a name="page2_151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>an art of no little importance, to
administer medicines properly; but it is an art of much greater
and more difficult acquisition, to know when to suspend, or
altogether omit them.&rdquo; <a name="citation151"></a><a
href="#footnote151" class="citation">[151]</a></p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 8.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1783.</h3>
<p>No statement on record.&nbsp; He was a respectable country
Clergyman: his friends say he was a hard student, neglecting
exercise, and all attention to himself or his health, and which
had, for some time previous to the attack of derangement, been in
a very precarious state&mdash;the attack was very sudden and
violent.</p>
<p>He has a leprous eruption, which has continued since the time
of his admission until now, without any very perceptibly
abatement.&nbsp; He was formerly the most furious maniac amongst
the old incurable cases, though less strikingly peculiar in his
appearance and manners than the one last described.&nbsp; During
the paroxysms of his greatest fury, he appeared like one whose
mind, from excruciating pain and dreadful mental provocation, was
wrought up to the highest pitch of passion and revenge; so that
he would, as though he had the object of his malignity before
him, be incessantly repeating, <a name="page2_152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>through whole nights and days, some
single phrase, such as, &ldquo;damn&rsquo;d dog,&rdquo; with a
sort of suppressed barking, roaring furiousness, even until he
foamed at the mouth, and his face was black with passion.</p>
<p>He was most violent when the eruption appeared least on the
external surface.&nbsp; When his mind was more at ease, he would
play like a little child for whole days together, with the merest
trifle, such as a piece of string or paper.&nbsp; At these times,
when given any thing he likes, he has something singularly
fascinating in his smile.</p>
<p>For this eruption, many things had been administered, without
any permanent advantage.&nbsp; Solution of nitric acid, about
three years ago, <a name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a> appeared to have, for a time, a good
effect; the eruption became somewhat less, and the mind less
violent: but this might arise from the debilitating effects,
rather than the radical removal of the cause of his
disease.&nbsp; After this, the solution of nitrate of potash, had
a good effect both on his mind and the disease of his skin,
without reducing or debilitating his system.&nbsp; He has lived,
for this last twelve months, on vegetable diet, and he is
apparently better; but this may be a fallacious appearance, since
his vital energies appear to be sinking.</p>

153</span>OBSERVATION VI.</h4>
<p>It has been said, by the late Dr. Jenner, and some others,
that cutaneous disorders are common to the insane.&nbsp; I should
think they are not very common. <a name="citation153"></a><a
href="#footnote153" class="citation">[153]</a>&nbsp; This is the
only case that I have seen, where the two have continued to exist
together.&nbsp; Whether it was the original cause of his mental
malady, I have not been able to ascertain, but it is certain, it
aggravated it.&nbsp; That mania, in some instances, follows the
disappearance of eruptions, ulcers, and other local diseases,
particularly with females, is satisfactorily established; but in
many instances, other causes co-operate.</p>
<p>In cases of dementia, arising apparently from continued
pressure on the brain, the surface, from the general bad habit of
the system, is liable to sores, boils, and ulcerations.&nbsp;
This cannot be called a cutaneous disease; it is rather a symptom
of the diseased state of the brain, than itself the cause of
insanity.&nbsp; Glandular swellings, however, seem to have a more
direct connection; but still they appear rather before, than
after the alienation has taken place.&nbsp; In a few cases, I
have noticed slight eruptions <a name="page2_154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>during recent paroxysms, and in two
or three, immediately previous to their convalescent state.&nbsp;
Had such appearances occurred more frequently, I should gladly
have regarded them as favourable prognostics; but they might
arise from strong medicines, their state of confinement, or they
might be mere accidental coincidences.&nbsp; There are many
instances of cures by accidental injuries, <a
name="citation154a"></a><a href="#footnote154a"
class="citation">[154a]</a> as well as by the accession of
consumption and other physical diseases.</p>
<p>Here I leave the question for the present, till I come to some
cases, where, according to the theory of such a connection
subsisting, (which I believe is the case in a few instances,) the
tartarized antimonial ointment has been applied; <a
name="citation154b"></a><a href="#footnote154b"
class="citation">[154b]</a> but I confess, that there is no part
of my experience in which my sanguine expectations of cure, after
a certain duration of the disease, on this principle of
counteraction, have been more disappointed.&nbsp; In the early
stages of insanity, it is decidedly the most valuable principle
in our practice.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 9.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1793.</h3>
<p>No statement on record, that gives any satisfactory <a
name="page2_155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>information.&nbsp; She was a respectable farmer&rsquo;s
wife, and her insanity was occasioned by her husband&rsquo;s
heavy losses of cattle.&nbsp; Her first symptom was throwing her
little infant at the feet of the parish officers, saying,
&ldquo;there, take it.&rdquo; <a name="citation155"></a><a
href="#footnote155" class="citation">[155]</a>&nbsp; She often
repeats, with a very moaning sound, and tears, &ldquo;God rest
thy soul, poor old mare.&rdquo;&nbsp; She will be easily known,
when I say, she is a poor, moaning, miserable looking imbecile,
constantly sitting cowering in a corner, always crying for
tobacco.&nbsp; She was one of those who were kept naked in loose
straw, and hence her inclination to undress herself, her dirty
habits, and her peculiar mode of sitting: indeed, formerly,
throughout the house, the lowest and worst patients had no seats
allowed them.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 10.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1793.</h3>
<p>Nothing recorded of this case.&nbsp; It is said, that when
young, he was severely kicked by a horse.&nbsp; There is now a
considerable indentation just above his left ear.</p>
<p>His mind, though extremely childish, is altogether <a
name="page2_156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>in a
torpid state, for the most part quiet and good-natured; but
sometimes, when more excited, he exhibits a love of mischief,
generally very childishly, but sometimes more seriously so. <a
name="citation156a"></a><a href="#footnote156a"
class="citation">[156a]</a>&nbsp; His temperament is phlegmatic,
and he has a heavy, dull look.&nbsp; He has been for years
employed in the garden.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 11.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1793.</h3>
<p>Nothing on record.&nbsp; I have been informed, that he was a
well-sinker, and that his insanity was the consequence of a
rheumatic fever.&nbsp; No one, except a complete idiot, can be in
a more stupidly stagnant state of mind; he scarcely notices any
thing, and never speaks unless spoken to, and then his answers
are merely monosyllables.&nbsp; About once in twelve months, a
slight exhibition of excitement shows itself in a sort of
ill-tempered obstinate fit, <a name="citation156b"></a><a
href="#footnote156b" class="citation">[156b]</a> but which soon
subsides, especially with the aid of sulphate of magnesia.&nbsp;
He is, together with No. 10, constantly employed in the
garden.</p>
<h4><a name="page2_157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>OBSERVATION VII.</h4>
<p>The observation which suggests itself on No. 10 and 11, is,
that from such facts as these, it is very evident, there can
scarcely be an old pauper patient in such a state as wholly
incapacitates him from being brought, with a little trouble, into
habits of useful employment.</p>
<p>As stupid men are generally less diverted from an object which
once engages their attention, than men of greater capacity; so it
is with these poor automata; if the first difficulty be but once
overcome, that of acquiring the habit of working, there is no
fear; but they will proceed in it more steadily than those who
feel that they have a right to consult their own choice.&nbsp;
They cannot be tempted, nor do they possess the power of giving
their energies a new direction; and hence, as habit gathers
strength, we may depend on them as on our time-pieces.&nbsp; If
amusements and employment are good for these, how much better for
those who are not past the hope of recovery; it may change the
object of their thoughts, and gradually turn them to one of a
less dangerous nature.&nbsp; I shall have some very interesting
cures, partly attributable to this principle, to state in due
course; in the mean time we perceive, that if even they are <a
name="page2_158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>past the
hope of recovery, they are kept in a better and more healthful
state; and what is more, it diffuses a satisfactory feeling
through the whole system, and they are made happier than they
would be by a life of idleness.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 12.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1797.</h3>
<p>Nothing on record; and I have failed in my efforts to obtain
any information of her previous history.&nbsp; It is said, that
her relations are respectable; yet her residence here is paid for
by a parish in London.&nbsp; She has long been, together with No.
7, the most useful and hardworking person in the house.&nbsp; In
the midst of her work, she will often scold and swear with
vehemence, but no one knows about what, or against whom; and
though her voice is loud and shrill, no one regards it, saying,
&ldquo;Oh! it is only poor M. W.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet she is very
kind-hearted and friendly, giving away her own meat, especially
to those who are ill; and when prevented from doing so, will
throw it away with indignation.&nbsp; She would gladly starve
herself to feed others; and always asserts, when a patient dies,
&ldquo;that they died for want of something to eat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She used to practice this singular fancy, that of frightening the
devil away, by taking a sweeping <a name="page2_159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>brush with her to bed; but now, a
tin pint serves the same purpose.&nbsp; She is a tall,
meagre-looking woman.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 13.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1798.</h3>
<p>No statement of this case; but it is said that, in the first
instance, he was very violent.&nbsp; His mind is now in a fixed
imbecile state, and exhibits no alteration, except the slight
changes which mere alterations of our spirits produce; when he is
more easily provoked&mdash;talks, laughs, and sings more, or
holds conversations with persons dead or absent; sometimes scolds
them, fancying they tease him in some strange manner, which he
calls &ldquo;triangling;&rdquo; but it is impossible to ascertain
what ideas he affixes to the word; he is a very quiet,
good-natured man, a general favourite, and is usefully employed
by the attendants in the house. <a name="citation159"></a><a

<p><a name="page2_160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>It
is said, that she gradually became insane, after the death of her
only boy, named &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; (who was the natural son
of Sir &mdash;:) this is probably true, as she now imagines that
Charles is constantly with her&mdash;sleeps with her&mdash;that
she feeds him at her meals&mdash;carries him about in a corner of
her apron&mdash;nurses him&mdash;and talks to him with delight
and maternal fondness.&nbsp; She often fancies, too, that she has
been confined, and has got more children. <a
name="citation160"></a><a href="#footnote160"
class="citation">[160]</a></p>
<p>Her appearance and manners are exceedingly polite, pleasing,
and affectionate; she is attentive to others, in all those little
nameless etiquettes of life, which, when regulated by truth,
constitute the innocent fascination of a kind-hearted and
well-bred character; and it is so with her: every one doats upon
her as upon a favourite child.&nbsp; She never fails to tell me,
if I have been out during dinner-time, when she next meets me,
&ldquo;you have not got your dinner, go and get it
immediately;&rdquo; and yet left to herself, she is wholly taken
up with scolding some imaginary beings who annoy her, get into
her throat, head, back, &amp;c., run her through with swords, and
do a thousand other strange and cruel things to her.&nbsp; Every
evening she has a long scolding, with a tone three-fourths of
anger <a name="page2_161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>and one-fourth affection, with some men who plague her
in her bed and in her bed-room, and continue to do so till her
attendant comes, sometimes at her call, to drive them away.&nbsp;
Is this the lingering last impression made on her mind by her
seducer?&nbsp; In the midst of her scolding she will often swear
in a strange under tone of voice; and when accused, she says it
is some other person, frequently Jack Swales.&nbsp; Her
conversation is so exceedingly extravagant and varied, that it is
impossible, except by the most lengthened description, to convey
to others any adequate conception of it.&nbsp; Names of dukes,
kings, queens, pipes of wine, sums of money, estates, &amp;c.,
are as common to her as household words; yet strange as all this
is, it seems to have some connexion with her past life, having
formerly held a situation in a family of consequence.&nbsp; Her
former situation and disposition are hinted at by these
reminiscences, which are delightful traits of what she has
been.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 15.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1799.&mdash;<i>Aged</i>
50.</h3>
<p>No statement on record; it is certain, however, from his own
account, that he was formerly steward and butler in a
gentleman&rsquo;s family, and had been what some call a
&ldquo;hearty good fellow&rdquo; all his life.&nbsp; His manner
continued that of a <a name="page2_162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>blustering, passionate,
half-inebriated man; <a name="citation162"></a><a
href="#footnote162" class="citation">[162]</a> his skin was
covered with a scorbutic eruption, and his face a bloated livid
red.&nbsp; He died of dropsy in the chest, March 6th, 1821.</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION VIII.</h4>
<p>The observation, or rather the moral, in this case is so
obvious, that it is almost superfluous to add, that from the
nature of his case, and his own account of himself, his system
both of body and mind had been brought into the extreme state of
morbid irritability by the conjoined excitement of the dissipated
companions, particularly of his early life,&mdash;unchecked in
their effects by the exercise of any moral restraint over
himself; and hence his mental powers and passions were not so
much shattered and decayed, as they were like a vessel without
its pilot, the sport of every wind and wave that assails it: bad
habits had become too inveterate to allow the will to be taught
obedience to reason; all measures of coercion, instead of
inducing self-control, could only irritate and exasperate, as he
was perhaps still less accessible by religion than by
reason.&nbsp; I believe, however, that by gentle, and indirect
means, he gradually <a name="page2_163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>became less boisterous in his
manners; but it is proper also to add, that from age and disease,
the sinking of his physical powers and animal spirits might
imperceptibly, but more effectually, tame him.</p>

<p>Nothing on record.&mdash;She is a neat, clean, but rather
crabbed-looking, middle-aged woman; and who, unless she is
provoked, is scarcely to be distinguished from the sane; but when
provoked, she is exceedingly abusive, and exhibits the deranged
state of her mind.&nbsp; She is very useful as a laundress, and
is known only by <a name="page2_164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>that name.&nbsp; The great objects of her affections
are cats and kittens. <a name="citation164"></a><a

<h3><i>No.</i> 18.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1800.</h3>
<p>Nothing on record.&mdash;He was an Italian, of a swarthy
complexion, dark eyes, black hair; and to look on his countenance
reminded one of an assassin, &ldquo;the mark was upon
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was subject to violent fits of excitement
when he was suspicious and thought himself insulted by a look or
a word; and from his ignorance of the English language, he might
perhaps have greater scope for suspicion.&nbsp; When offended, he
gnashed his teeth; striking one hand violently against the other;
appearing from these, and various other indications, to be
preparing for action, and lashing himself into a state of the
most determined revenge, he watched his opportunity, and seizing
his victim with his teeth, was quite delighted if he drew
blood.&nbsp; He bit several, some seriously; and in one instance,
he bit a piece completely out of the lip of another.&nbsp; They
all agree in the house that they never saw a patient so
ferocious, or one where harsh measures <i>seemed</i> more
justifiable; yet nothing could <a name="page2_165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>conquer him&mdash;his attendant
believes &ldquo;he would have died first.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was no
accidental result of passion, but the settled object of his mind.
<a name="citation165a"></a><a href="#footnote165a"
class="citation">[165a]</a>&nbsp; He would chuckle and triumph
over the injury he had done; and this was the more remarkable, as
his mind in other respects was so much gone, that he continued to
the time of his leaving the asylum, occasionally a dirty
patient.&nbsp; Still it ought to be stated, that this ferocious
disposition and these dirty habits, if they had not been
absolutely grafted on his natural disposition, must have at any
rate been made much worse by his brutalizing treatment; for he
was one of those who were formerly kept naked in loose
straw,&mdash;besides having during this time lost his toes,
supposed to be from his exposure to the cold, he could not so
well defend himself, and so might have been taught by necessity
to have recourse to his teeth.&nbsp; That he was made worse by
his treatment, is evident, as latterly he became sensible of
kindness, and improved in personal cleanliness; and his general
manners indicated much less malignity of feeling; indeed
something like affection <a name="citation165b"></a><a
href="#footnote165b" class="citation">[165b]</a> and gratitude to
his attendants, began to excite in them, without <a
name="page2_166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>effort,
kindly feelings towards him.&nbsp; At first, (after the new state
of things) it was with the utmost difficulty that he was made to
keep his clothes on, or to be kept clean; but latterly, for many
weeks together, he went on without any restraint whatever.&nbsp;
He was removed in May, 1822.</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION IX.</h4>
<p>The observations that naturally suggest themselves on this
case on the efficiency of mild treatment, are so obvious, that it
would be obtrusive particularly to state them.&nbsp; I cannot,
however, omit adverting to the fact of the probability of his
having lost his toes by exposure to cold, because it illustrates
the remark made in observation V.&nbsp; Patients, in former
times, were kept naked in loose straw; and from their exposure to
cold, mortifications in the extreme parts were common; and then
writers on insanity say, that mortification of the extreme parts
and insensibility to cold, are symptoms of mental
derangement!!&mdash;See also observation 12th.</p>

<p>He is constantly muttering and talking to himself, apparently
busy in making calculations, holding in his hand something he
calls an almanack, made by himself, as well as some pieces of
money he has polished.&nbsp; He repeats something, seemingly as a
duty imposed upon him, perhaps meant as a prayer.&nbsp; Though
the shrivelled and decayed scraps of mind that remain, look only
like the apparitions of his previous habits of life; yet they so
wholly engross his attention, that he never notices passing and
external objects around him.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, he can
with great difficulty be for a moment diverted from his object,
and while roused, will answer questions with considerable point
and shrewdness, but returns as quickly into the same uniform
abstracted state.</p>
<p>He is evidently of a contented and happy disposition.&nbsp;
There is something in his appearance and countenance which seems
to say, &ldquo;I have been a respectable and good-natured

<p>The only observation here is one which I shall notice more
particularly when I come to treat on the efficacy of moral
management&mdash;viz. that, notwithstanding the deranged state of
his mind, and the imaginary objects which occupy his attention,
still he can be roused for a moment to something like a proper
use of his faculties.</p>

violent maniac.&nbsp; He was kept naked on loose straw.&nbsp;
Since that time it is said he was improved by a seton; but still
he was to the last a stupid, heavy, idiotical looking man, and in
reality was so. <a name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"
class="citation">[168]</a>&nbsp; That he was less dirty, and kept
himself dressed, was owing to better habits, into which proper
management had gradually moulded him.&nbsp; But his mind was
irrecoverably gone; he was motionless and silent, unless spoken
to, or urged to some action.&nbsp; His replies were merely
monosyllabic, <a name="page2_169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Nothing on record.&mdash;He was one of those who was formerly
kept naked on loose straw.&nbsp; He has been for years, for the
most part, in a moping, poring, and solitary looking state; yet
he has had occasional seasons of excitement, when the disposition
towards furious revenge seemed to possess him, so much so, that
he would, unprovoked, place his back against a corner of the wall
in the attitude of self-defence, shaking his doubled fists in a
daring and threatening manner.&nbsp; Though these effervescences
of his spirits occur as frequently as ever, yet the malicious
disposition seems dying away, and instead of which he will, at
these periods, sing a little comic air, and give other
indications of his mind being happy and full of good-nature, as
much so as the little mind he possesses will enable him to be,
if, indeed, beings in such a state can be said to have minds at
all; for what an appalling difference between them and minds <a
name="page2_170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>enriched
with laborious habits of reading and reflection!</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION XI.</h4>
<p>In addition to the observations already made on former and
present treatment, it is only justice further to say, that
amongst recent patients, I have scarcely seen (if indeed I have
seen) one instance of continued revenge.&nbsp; Their spirits
exhibit themselves in good or ill-nature, according to the
direction that is given them, and even in the old cases, as in
the one above stated, it appears simply the remains of their
former usage; so that if their minds are still agitated in some
sort with feelings of revenge, it is only like the sea which will
fluctuate awhile after the storm has ceased; but the winds are
hushed, and every wave becomes less and less, until it subsides
into a calm.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 22.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1801.</h3>
<p>Nothing on record.&mdash;I have been informed, that his mind
was instantly wrecked by the female of his heart unexpectedly
marrying another the very day previous to that on which she had
promised to be made his own for ever.&nbsp; He was an idiot, who
could barely answer in a <a name="page2_171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>low whisper, and to a few very
simple questions, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was old, and pale, and thin&mdash;had a long face&mdash;his head
hanging forwards&mdash;his stare was ludicrously vacant and
goggling&mdash;his lower jaw fallen, and saliva flowing over his
large hanging lip&mdash;though he generally stood quietly in a
corner with his face to the wall, yet sometimes he would for some
hours together make a strange and disagreeable noise&mdash;what
was still more disgusting about him, he had the sickening habit
of bringing up his food and regorging it, yet, in other respects
he was not a dirty patient&mdash;perhaps because having been with
a better class, he had received more attention.&mdash;He had this
singular fancy, that if he had one or fifty pieces of bread and
butter, he would eat, or secrete, or pocket them all, except
one.&nbsp; He gradually declined from old age, and died in
December, 1821.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 23.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1801.</h3>
<p>No statement of his case.&nbsp; It is reported that he was a
clever man, a hard student, fond of political subjects, and that
speculations on the national debt were the cause of his
insanity.&mdash;This report receives a colouring of probability
from two large trunks full of books now in the Asylum belonging
to him, almost wholly on <a name="page2_172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>subjects of political science, among
which is a large collection of pamphlets on the national debt,
and it is apparently confirmed by the nature of his
hallucination; only I cannot trace the report to any certain
source.&nbsp; It is certain he was Superintendant of the Police
at Bombay.</p>
<p>His appearance and manners are very peculiar, and very
difficult to describe.&nbsp; He holds his head forwards and
obliquely upwards in a calculating position; moving his hands in
different directions, and working with his fingers like unto one
gathering something in the air.&mdash;At times he extends and
stretches his hands higher than his head, moving and working them
in the same manner: he will hold his face directly
upwards&mdash;open and shut his mouth in a gaping and catching
style, as if he were feeding on air; repeating these operations,
and intermingling them with a strange gurgling noise in his
throat&mdash;almost always muttering to himself as if he held
busy converse with his own thoughts, with visible appearances of
pleasure or anger on his countenance, occasioned by his imaginary
operations being successful or otherwise.</p>
<p>Though he is sometimes as immoveable as a statue, yet he is
for the most part moving about, and has a singular mode of
treading with his feet like one who has been accustomed to a
tread-mill, lifting them higher than <a
name="page2_173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>necessary, and setting them down
cautiously,&mdash;sometimes pulling off his
shoes&mdash;sometimes, however, quickening all his motions, as if
something required extraordinary haste and dispatch; and thus he
marches about like some star-gazer treading on precious and frail
materials; seldom more than a few moments in one place, and in
all his movements in different rooms and parts and corners of his
gallery, stairs, and airing court, and in all his operations and
mutterings it is evident that he, in his imagination, is
performing some essential part of his <i>mighty task of paying
the national debt</i>, for when any of his operations or
mutterings are interrupted, like one whose studies are suddenly
broken in upon at some unlucky moment, he seems vexed and
unhinged; sometimes bursting into a violent passion, when he is
most eloquent in the use of scurrilous epithets (a proof that to
use abusive epithets requires very little mind) calling the
person who has impeded him in his great work, low-bred, mean,
dirty scoundrel, rascal, villain, thief, vagabond, madman;
accusing him of being the cause of the loss of many millions to
the nation, threatening him with the direst punishment,
particularly that he shall be whipped in the air.&nbsp; He is
otherwise remarkably quiet and inoffensive, and uniformly intent
upon this object, except that sometimes, as already stated, he
appears unhinged <a name="page2_174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>and irritable by the unsuccessful issue of his
calculations, and is then more liable to take offence, especially
at any disrespectful deportment towards him, for it must be
observed that he is still very fond of his title and of that
deference due to a man of rank.&nbsp; Occasionally, like some
alchemist of old, he fancies that some &auml;erial being, which
he calls the clown of the air, plagues him in various strange
ways and interrupts his operations, for which mischievous
interference he, in his way, severely scolds him.</p>
<p>The politeness which may be traced in his manners, is
evidently the result or remains of his old habits, as he is so
absorbed in abstract speculations that all attention to himself
or external objects is utterly excluded; he is always solitary,
but it is like the solitariness of one whose intense studies
allow him no time for fellowship or the exercise of social
feelings, so much so, that notwithstanding a consciousness of
kind and respectful treatment towards him, he scarcely yet seems
to know the name of his attendant.</p>
<p>Although his system is delicately susceptible of changes of
temperature, he scarcely ever notices it himself; and when roused
to pay attention to his feelings, he says that it is the clown in
the air that has teased him with the iron ague.</p>
<p><a name="page2_175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>He
has been subject to occasional attacks of asthma, brought on,
apparently, by exposure to cold in the night time, during these
operations, (for he frequently jumps out of his bed to carry on
this great patriotic duty.)</p>
<p>Though he can, if properly roused and managed, still answer
questions much more correctly than all these appearances would
indicate, yet it is evident that his mind is gradually declining,
from age, exertion, and the nature of his case; he is an object
of interest and sympathy, and nothing can exceed the way in which
it is shewn towards him by his attendant.</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION XII.</h4>
<p>The correspondence between the insane state and the previous
character and habits are in most cases, and certainly in this,
very striking.&nbsp; On this subject I refer to the Essay on the
Changes and Correspondence between the previous Natural
Character, and that which they exhibit in their Insane State.</p>
<p>There is another fact in this last case, which may
conveniently serve the purpose of introducing some observations
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE EFFECTS OF HEAT AND COLD AND THE
STATE AND CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE IN INSANE PERSONS</span>, which
may be considered as an <a name="page2_176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Appendage to the remarks made in
Observation V. and IX.</p>
<p>The fact to which I allude in this case is this, viz. that his
system &ldquo;is delicately susceptible of changes of
temperature, but that he himself scarcely ever notices
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hallucinations of the insane are purely intellectual,
and wholly and intensely occupy the attention, the generation of
animal heat appears less than usual; and decidedly less than in
those cases where the aberrations of the mind are connected with
the stimulus of selfish and exciting passions,&mdash;hence the
system is cold.&nbsp; But this arises rather from defective
quantity of heat, than from any irregularity in its distribution;
and thus, while the mind, from its state of abstraction, either
disregards, or is wholly unconscious of exposure to the cold, the
body is very sensibly and strongly affected by it.</p>
<p>In the last stages of gradual decay of mind, the changes and
disturbances in the quantity, state, and diffusion of heat,
resemble that observable in paralytics; there is great
insensibility to heat and cold, and the infliction of pain; and,
previous to the period of their dissolution, the slightest
pressure, even so slight as to give no pain, produces
ulcerations, which rapidly degenerate into gangrenous
ulcers.&mdash;In old torpid cases of neglect&mdash;cases of
suspension <a name="page2_177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>of mind; and in cases of pure mental abstraction, it is
deficient in quantity, although equable in its diffusion.</p>
<p>In all these cases, as well as in cases of over activity of
mind, especially during violent paroxysms, there is a general
loss, or want, of consciousness to the usual impression of the
corporeal system.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, this consciousness is
on some points morbidly acute, indicated by strange sounds, and
sights, desires, or aversions, &amp;c., according to the parts or
organs affected.&nbsp; In fact, it is this undue concentration of
energy, which abstracts or confuses, rather than destroys the
proper diffusion of consciousness.</p>
<p>Hence the insane, during violent paroxysms, bear the want of
sleep and food, resist the action of severe cold, and the effects
of large doses of strong medicines.&nbsp; In most cases their
minds are so absorbed or suspended during their paroxysms that
passing and external events are wholly excluded, and though some
few, after their recovery, vividly remember their dreadful
dreams; to others, all has been a blank, and they feel just as a
person feels respecting that section of the country in which he
happens to sleep as he travels; but all these things, (which I
intend shall be noticed more particularly hereafter,) are not
peculiar to the insane, as has been held by some; they are <a
name="page2_178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>equally
the case with patients during the paroxysms and delirium in the
inflammatory stage of fevers.&nbsp; Indeed, the same principle is
exemplified in the cases of men of spirit or energy, who, during
the excitement produced by the achievement of some difficult
enterprise, bear the want of food and sleep, and resist the
effects of cold and exhaustion, to an extent which would seem to
have exempted them from the common laws of humanity, and these
are the incidents in life which are never forgotten; but then, as
with the insane, this extraordinary expenditure of the cerebral
energy leaves the system exhausted, and it requires all our art
and care to recover the enfeebled powers.&nbsp; It is this
critical period of convalescence which is so important, and so
difficult in the management of the insane.</p>
<p>I further observe, that the variation of temperature of the
system, observed during paroxysms of insanity, is more like that
produced by the passions in a state of excitement than that which
accompanies inflammatory fever.&nbsp; It appears to fluctuate in
quantity, and to be tumultuous in its distribution, in proportion
as the exciting and depressing passions are active and contending
with each other.&nbsp; In proof of the truth of this, I need only
mention that every thing which excites the malignant passions, or
produces misery and distraction of mind, increases these
appearances.&nbsp; <a name="page2_179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>I allude not merely to the
expression of the countenance, but to the absolute heat of
different parts of the system,&mdash;of different parts of the
head in particular, of which they complain and to which they
point distinctly, being often sensible to the external touch of
another.&nbsp; It is to be remarked, that the changes and unequal
diffusion of heat in other parts of the body correspond with the
general and particular state of the mind: indeed the condition,
(as it regards health or disease) of each part of the bodily
system, directly or indirectly, corresponds with, and indicates
states of the mind: but this truth requires more than an
observation to do it justice; I make the remark, however, in the
mean time, because there is no better guide to us in our
treatment than this knowledge, and it explains this temperature
as one of the corresponding effects.&nbsp; And though I shall not
now enter on the medical nature of the treatment these
indications afford us, neither is it necessary to say what kind
of moral treatment they point out to us as our wisest course to
pursue.&nbsp; In all such cases, and indeed in every case, we
ought always to be anxious not only to keep our sympathies alive,
but, in order that we may never fail rightly to direct them, we
must also possess ourselves of a thorough knowledge of the mind,
and its individual <a name="page2_180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>peculiarities.&mdash;To give settled
calmness and tranquillity to the distracted mind, and bloom to
the wild and faded countenance, ought not to be considered
matters of trifling importance.</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION XIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE EFFECTS OF INTENSE STUDY, AND
GENERAL INTEMPERANCE OF MIND.</span></h4>
<p>Though the effect of intense study and general intemperance of
mind, may be better illustrated by many cases than by the
preceding, yet for the sake of the moral deducible from the
combined view of this part of the subject, and the preceding
observations on the distribution of animal heat, I am tempted
briefly to glance at the important reflections included within
it; intending to resume a more elaborate consideration of its
merits when I come to the Essay on the Causes which produce
Insanity.</p>
<p>In those cases where intense study has been considered as the
exciting cause of insanity, I have almost always been able, on
closer investigation, to trace it rather to the intemperate
feelings and sentiments of the mind, combined with the
injudicious mode of procedure and irregular habits attending
it.&nbsp; In young students, these <a name="page2_181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>studies are blamed; but, alas! how
often have I ascertained that much greater and more decided
causes (<i>secret and wicked causes</i>) have long been
exercising the most baneful influence.&nbsp; In cases of regular
and well-balanced exertion, however severe, the effects were
rather a general depression and weakness of the whole nervous
system than absolute derangement, producing either debility or
suspension of mind, but which for its restoration required only
cessation from accustomed exertions.&nbsp; Calmness and
tranquillity, combined with innocent diversions and general
attention to hygeian rules, invariably effected a cure.</p>
<p>I am the more particular on this point, as some authors on the
subject of insanity seem almost to discourage all mental exertion
whatever; whereas, we should never lose an opportunity of
repeating the common observation, that the judicious exercise of
mind, as well as body, is equally conducive to health and
strength, as it is to mental improvement and worth.&nbsp; Rightly
to apportion and conjoin the exercise of the feelings and
understanding, as well as of the corporeal frame, constitutes the
whole of Physiology as applied to health.&nbsp; When the civil
duties of life are performed from right motives, we then are
obedient to the first law of nature, as well as of the Decalogue:
then all is healthy co-operation&mdash;<a
name="page2_182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>all
portions of the system have their fair proportion of
exercise&mdash;none are over-worked, neither in the individual
nor in the mass&mdash;neither in body nor in mind, as we at
present see to be the case, singly and collectively: everywhere
the effect is similar, destructive alike of all healthy, mental,
and corporeal energy, and of all the sweet ties and charities of
life which bind families and societies together.</p>
<p>It is remarked by Dr. Arnold and Dr. Penel, that most
mathematicians and philosophers have not only lived to an
advanced age, but have enjoyed good health, and have been exempt
from mental diseases.&nbsp; Perhaps the number of such men
vouchsafed to the world, has been too inconsiderable to enable us
to form any correct comparative estimate between them and the
rest of mankind, yet reason proclaims it true; and as far as
medical statistics furnish us with facts, they all tend to
confirm the truth.&nbsp; Certain it is, that nothing conduces so
much to health and long life as conduct, well regulated, and a
mind habitually preserved in a state of intellectual
calmness.</p>
<p>Such exercise of the reflective faculties not merely
subjugates, but virtually diminishes the energy of the passions;
for reflection convinces that every improper gratification must
produce dangerous consequences.&nbsp; The very exertion of
thought on subjects of exact <a name="page2_183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>enquiry, by appropriating the vital
energies to its more exalted purposes, abstracts as much from the
strength of the passions and propensities as it adds might to the
powers of reason and conscience to subdue and control them.&nbsp;
On the contrary, persons with vacant and ill-regulated minds,
(instead of possessing the passport to the wise and good, whose
habits create in the social circle cheerfulness and felicity, and
from thence diffuse these blessings to others around them,) fly,
when unoccupied, to those who expend the energies of their
existence in senseless follies or sensual gratifications.&nbsp;
The virtuous man has an ever-living zeal about him, which
benevolence warmly inspires, and truth calmly regulates.&nbsp;
There is no destructive warfare among the powers of his mind, as
is the case with those whose zeal is <i>generated by pride</i>,
<i>and nourished by malignity</i>, but his more noble faculties
take the lead in activity, and superintend the whole; all are
cheered and invigorated by the co-operation and harmony that
reigns among them.&nbsp; It is wonderful how with this proper
balance and use of the faculties they stimulate each other, and
keep the mind alive;&mdash;&ldquo;Peace is within these walls,
prosperity within these palaces.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a one alone
possesses his soul with the full use of its instruments of
operation.&nbsp; Where the powers of body mind are well
balanced&mdash;every thing is in its <a
name="page2_184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>place&mdash;every part subservient to every
other&mdash;all reduced to practice&mdash;then the mental and
corporeal powers wear well&mdash;age brings few diseases, and no
apprehensions&mdash;our peace of mind becomes more
settled&mdash;our wisdom greater&mdash;our friendships more
valuable, and we come to the grave in a full age, like a shock of
corn in its season.&nbsp; To say, that knowledge is power, is
only to assert half the truth: it is knowledge combined with
moral worth, or as Solomon more beautifully expresses it,
&ldquo;Wisdom is Strength.&rdquo;&mdash;Without virtue, knowledge
is ruinous and destructive; with it, the progress of improvement
and happiness is illimitable,&mdash;here providence
smiles&mdash;there she frowns; this is equally applicable to
individuals as well as nations.&nbsp; History is but one large
commentary on this truth, and when men (indeed such a period
appears now to dawn) have learned wisdom by the severe lessons of
providence, then the Rise and Progress, not &ldquo;the Decline
and Fall, of Empires,&rdquo; will be the title of the volumes of
some future historian.</p>
<p>Were it not for the vast importance of the subject, this might
seem the place to introduce some observations on that most
grievous error so common among religious persons, of supposing
that God requires, on sacred matters, the abnegation of
reason&mdash;of that reason which distinguishes men, and without
which there <a name="page2_185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>is no distinction between us and brutes;&mdash;it is
not merely our will, or affections, or instincts, but this will
combined with the superadded attribute of our own understanding
which makes us men, and makes us even images and likenesses, (so
far as the will and understanding are united, and exist in
perfection,) of our Maker!&nbsp; These doctors teach their
hearers to dethrone reason, in order, as they say, that the
Gospel, the grace, the wisdom, the justice, and goodness of God,
may be exalted thereon.&nbsp; They call all this a reasonable and
acceptable service.&nbsp; Strange paradox!&nbsp; Wonderful
perversion, that a view so contradictory and false can be
enforced with a fiery zeal that proves it is believed, embraced,
and retained under the influence of the fear, (and not the
conviction in the understanding,) that it is essential to their
salvation! yet I know this doctrine is the main branch, or the
first fruits of that grand fundamental error which is called in
the strong prophetic language of Scripture, &ldquo;the
abomination which maketh desolate.&rdquo;&mdash;Some of the
effects are, separating faith from charity, truth from goodness,
<i>the will from the understanding</i>; and all that God hath,
according to the laws of order in the Creation ordained to be
joined together, it tears asunder, throwing the mind into a
dislocated and distracted state, destructive alike of its peace,
and of the <a name="page2_186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>bonds which preserve society together:&mdash;madness,
wickedness, infidelity, and anarchy are the fruits which it
produces.</p>
<p>If people are destroyed for lack of knowledge&mdash;if to hate
the light is a proof of deeds being evil&mdash;if the fear of the
Lord is the beginning of wisdom&mdash;if this knowledge is the
continent in the mind for the reception of every other what shall
we say of those who teach&mdash;that this&mdash;the first, the
best, the godlike gift of the Creator, must be sacrificed in
order to embrace the view of religion which they propose?&nbsp; I
cannot use stronger language than I have used already, but repeat
that mental alienation is one of the dreadful consequences of
that doctrine which is emphatically called the &lsquo;abomination
which maketh desolate;&rsquo;&mdash;of that doctrine, whose
fruits are bitter, and which fills the mind with doubt, gloom,
and misery.</p>
<p>When the only true basis of religious knowledge is removed,
and insane notions occupy its place, what desolation follows!</p>
<p>At present, however, I will not enter into a clear and full
explanation of this momentous subject; but I trust hereafter I
shall be able show, that I am fully prepared to prove these
assertions, and, moreover, to prove that, besides the extremes of
pride and presumption, despair and misery, with endless
indications that it is not according to the <a
name="page2_187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>wisdom
which cometh from above, it is the most common and frightful
cause of the most incurable forms of insanity which I have found
in lunatic asylums, I repeat, however, that so important and
awfully true are these facts in my estimation, that I cannot
remain contented with simply making these slight allusions to
them, and I therefore intend hereafter to attack the error with
all the force which my conception of its magnitude and baneful
influence can inspire.&nbsp; Oh! that I could attack it with such
effect that it would be rooted up for ever&mdash;so that it would
no longer exist as the cause, (as it has hitherto been,) of
gloom, misery, and desolation to minds of the most gentle,
amiable, and acute construction.&nbsp; Such would not be the case
did mankind behold the delightful harmony which exists between
revealed truth and the constitution of the human mind.&nbsp; I
see no lines and separations in knowledge, but behold in each
part a portion of one grand whole.&nbsp; Science, intelligence,
wisdom, and religion, are all <span class="smcap">One</span>, and
woe to the man who separates them!</p>
<p>O that mankind knew these glorious truths, which are
everywhere most beautifully held forth to our view&mdash;not only
knew these things, but knew also the happiness of making all this
knowledge increase the well being and happiness of others around
them!&nbsp; Then would the <a name="page2_188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>world possess the channels for the
right influx of the inspiration of the heart; and then would that
true and steady light be received into the understanding which
would prevent it from falling into the mazes and darkness of
error, or into actual evils and miseries of heart and of
life.</p>
<p>Then, indeed, would the fire of Divine Love purify the earth
of the human mind;&mdash;then would the oil of charity be the
fuel on the altar of every heart;&mdash;then would the light of
Divine Wisdom ascend into understanding, there to remain a sun
without clouds for ever.</p>

respectably: her health was rendered delicate by close
confinement at her needle-work, and her fondness for reading and
writing.&nbsp; She was from home when her mind received a severe
shock by the unexpected intelligence of her father having put an
end to his own existence.&nbsp; Soon after this a grievous
disappointment completed the overthrow of her mind.&nbsp; Before
her father&rsquo;s death, it was generally supposed he was
wealthy: she was then engaged to one who had secured her
affections; after her lover knew of her father&rsquo;s death, <a
name="page2_189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>and the
involved state of his affairs, he still continued to profess his
attachment, and held out the prospect of speedily fulfilling his
promise of marriage;&mdash;she believed him, until she happened
accidentally in company to cast her eye on the announcement of
his marriage to another, when she shuddered and shrieked, and
exclaimed &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; and from that moment she was
insane, and has been so ever since.&nbsp; Her lucid intervals are
considerable; yet she always retains so painful a recollection of
this fact, that though fond of talking of all other occurrences
of her former life, she studiously evades all conversation, or
any question that at all alludes to this; so much so, that from
this fact, as well as some others, I think it highly probable
that even her present less violent, and less frequent paroxysms,
are partly brought on by associations which awaken the same agony
of mind and feelings of indignation as she then suffered.&nbsp;
When highly excited, she will, like one who has received some
extreme provocation, (her face red and swoln with rage) burst
forth into the most violent passion, using the most scurrilous
language; sometimes it is maniacal fury; at other times, only
like one excessively angry, venting feelings by a hearty
scolding; at others, she is only perverse and sulky, and
frequently merely odd and flighty.&nbsp; All these symptoms for
the most part occur, more or less, at certain <a
name="page2_190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>periods,
(see Observation V. and Essay on Atmospherical Influence,) but
now they are something less violent at all times, and sometimes,
for many months in succession, so slight that strangers could not
perceive them, when she continues conversable and pleasant.&nbsp;
She is very agreeable and useful in the house, which she
considers her home.&nbsp; Perhaps this improvement may be
attributed partly to the application of the medical
swing&mdash;partly to the greater mildness of her present
attendant: she is made happy by a little attention, and often
visits her friends in York.&nbsp; Her natural talents are good,
and improved by reading; her disposition is friendly and
benevolent, but hasty, credulous, and incautious.</p>

<p>Nothing satisfactory on record.&nbsp; I have been informed by
his family and friends, that he was a proud, passionate, spoiled
child, and that the immediate exciting causes of his derangement
were these.&nbsp; Through the interest of an elder brother, he
expected to obtain a most lucrative and respectable situation in
the East Indies, but it was discovered on his examination that he
did not possess the requisite qualifications, consequently, he
was not merely <a name="page2_191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>disappointed, but his pride was doubly mortified by
being reduced to the necessity of undertaking the management of a
common farm; there, with several other causes, these things
operating on a spirit ill prepared for any adverse wind or the
common storms of life, soured his temper; and at last produced so
exasperated and violent a state of mind, that his mother,
sisters, and friends, were compelled on account of various
outrageous acts of passion to confine him.</p>

<p>It is said that he was so violent after this, that it was
deemed necessary to punish him, by chaining him for years, at
times, to another patient; and yet, notwithstanding this
treatment, it is evident from the remark of an old journal he
then wrote, that he possessed a considerable proportion of mind;
there are many excellent reflections on general subjects, joined,
it is true, with what must appear to others, trivial
observations, on the conduct of the attendants in the
house.&nbsp; About two years ago he was subject to maniacal fits
of outrageous passion, when his manner was proud and stalking,
his voice loud and blustering, and his language contemptuous and
imperative; calling the house his own; commanding every one of us
as his servants, in grand style.&nbsp; The mention of a single
fact, out of an immense number, will be sufficient to
characterise his spirit and manners.&nbsp; Often have I seen him
look at the patients with ineffable arrogance and contempt, and
<a name="page2_192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>say,
in a style which no acting could imitate, &ldquo;Take this dog
out of my sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This violence and noise was so exciting to others, and unhappy
for himself, that after various attempts by methods of kindness
and argumentation, he was, without any previous threat, taken to
the medical swing, where I told him that I was sorry to be
obliged to apply so severe a medicine, but that I was certain
from his conduct lately he must be very unwell, and that this
would cure him, and more to the same purpose.&nbsp; Since this
time, I have never heard any noise, or seen any violence about
him.&nbsp; The name of the swing, after this, was enough to check
him; but now even this was not necessary, and his seasons of
excitement have from self restraint disappeared; and he is now,
though an old incurable case, much more social than he was.&nbsp;
In fact, he appears affable to me, and in some measure, even is
so to the patients around him.&nbsp; He is fond of whist, and has
very much improved in the game; and when I add to this, that
reading the newspapers, walking, taking large quantities of
snuff, and laying leaning on his arm, fill up his time, and that
he is a dark, cadaverous, sulky, proud, gaunt looking man, all
the house will know him. <a name="citation192"></a><a

<p>She is at present in a state of imbecility of mind, and she
looks a quiet, timid, silent, motionless, stupid creature,
sitting continually in the same posture, like one <i>almost</i>

timid, yet her mind is irritable, wanting, however, courage for
retaliation, so that when provoked, she looks angry, but walks
away: she never speaks unless spoken to, and then her answers are
short, but mostly correct, though it is evidently all force
work.&nbsp; This has been for years her state, or rather
debility, with scarcely any perceptible changes, except that her
mind appears gradually sinking.&nbsp; She was formerly more
conversable, and would have done something at her needle, but at
present she is always idle, and has latterly, from inaction,
become less cleanly in her person.</p>

his meat, and sometimes other things, into his ears, shoes,
breeches, and different parts of his dress.</p>

<p>Once for all, I must say of these old cases, since there is no
book or documents concerning them, that the origin, nature, and
progress of the disease cannot now be known except from enquiries
directly made, either by writing, or of such friends as may
occasionally visit them; and with many of these lower class of
patients, it cannot of course surprise us that they should not
have any friends to visit them after such a lapse of time.&nbsp;
This is more likely to be the fact when the character of the case
is of a more revolting nature&mdash;as is very singularly so of
the one I am about to describe.&nbsp; Yet she has had visitors,
from whom, however, I was not able to gather any information upon
which I could depend; her insanity was said to be hereditary, she
having a sister who is insane.</p>
<p>She is one of those old cases which, in former <a
name="page2_197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>times in
this institution, were kept naked in loose straw and not allowed
seats; and hence she now, from this deprivation, sits huddled up,
resting on her calves, when worn out by her violence, curled up
like an urchin in a corner in a sort of dog sleep, the slightest
noise instantly rousing her, when she starts into her strangely
agitated state,&mdash;shaking her head and gnashing her teeth,
and uttering horrible curses with a sort of barking, hoarse, and
hideous gutteral sound, apparently against some object present to
her imagination; in this violence she formerly continued,
sometimes for weeks, latterly only for days, with the most part
only for hours, with scarcely any intermission.&nbsp; In fact,
she was in appearance and manner the most brutal and blasphemous
demon&mdash;no imagination can picture any thing at all equal to
the awful reality; and yet it is a remarkable fact, that, some
years since, her intellect was restored by a very decided
physical cause, the breaking of her leg; when, during the process
of the bone uniting, her reason returned: her manners were mild,
grateful, and affable, and the tone of her voice was soft and
sweet; and again, when her leg was healed, she relapsed into the
same violent state.&nbsp; It has continued, excepting a short
convalescence during an attack of dysentery: and this is now more
than seven years ago; and after which, an artificial <a
name="page2_198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>drain was
kept open, but with no apparent benefit; the dysenteric attack
was also imitated, but with no further benefit or effect than its
mere physical depressing influence at the time.&nbsp; It is
worthy of notice, that when taken to the swing <a
name="citation198"></a><a href="#footnote198"
class="citation">[198]</a> a second time, she talked more
sensibly, refrained from swearing, promised to behave better, and
in a sweet tone begged not to be swung: since this time, she has
been less violent, has shaken her head and sworn less than
before; indeed she has a more good-natured manner, and very often
expends her excitement in mirthful dancing and singing, and
generally seizes my hand, that I may dance with her.</p>
<h4>OBSERVATION XVIII.</h4>
<p>Though the doctrine of Demons, or being possessed, has been
discarded; yet, in my opinion, it deserves a more serious
consideration than medical men imagine:&mdash;it involves the
true theory of mind and matter, their connection with each other,
and the principles on which this connection depends, and by which
it is regulated.&nbsp; I shall leave this question for the
present, with the intention of returning to it at some future
opportunity.&nbsp; However, one <a name="page2_199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>thing this case serves to prove and
illustrate, which is, that whatever mysterious link the mind may
constitute in the order of being, it is certain that this is
according to or dependant on the physical condition of the
material organs through which this connection operates, so that
the physical reasoning on disordered and diseased organization
remains precisely the same, whether we admit or deny that the
visible, and invisible world subsist together and are in
indissoluble connection.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 30.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1808.&mdash;<i>Aged</i>
47.</h3>
<p>I have not been able to obtain a very accurate or full history
of this old and incurable case.&nbsp; He was a clergyman of the
Church of England.&nbsp; He had been a hard reader and
distinguished student at Cambridge, and he now gives proof of his
having been an excellent classic.&nbsp; It is said, that after he
had obtained a small vicarage, although not an immoral man, he
was gay and expensive in his habits.&nbsp; After the age of
thirty, he hastily married an exceedingly beautiful girl of about
sixteen years of age, but who was uneducated and from a low
station of life.&nbsp; Afterwards discovering her deficiencies as
a companion, his love cooled into indifference, and his naturally
proud, impatient, <a name="page2_200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>and uncontrollable temper was made
worse; he treated her harshly, their quarrels became habitual,
and they lived in hatred, misery, and distraction together.</p>
<p>In this state of his disappointed affections he was seduced
into various intrigues.&nbsp; Shame, conscience, and loss of
character, quarrels with his parishioners, aggravated at the same
time by a fall from his horse on his head, increased his natural
irratibility of temper, and so mortified his pride, that he
became desperate and attempted suicide.&nbsp; After this he had a
regular paroxysm of maniacal violence, which subsided, although
it has returned with considerable increasing intervals up to this
time.</p>
<p>During his lucid intervals, he will talk of the harshness with
which he was used, when it was first considered necessary to
remove him from home; and there is no doubt there is some truth
in his statements: at the same time it seems right to observe
that, if in any instance it can be excusable to allow our natural
feelings for a moment to overcome us, this was one of such
cases.&nbsp; The proud, malignant, and contemptuous manner
displayed in his violence, was irritating in the extreme.</p>
<p>About eight years ago, he continued for some time in a perfect
state of convalescence, and when the paroxysm returned, its
violence and duration appeared in proportion to the <a
name="page2_201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>length of
intermission.&nbsp; These paroxysms and intervals of
convalescence have since preserved the same ratio to each
other.&nbsp; It is remarkable that the last interval of
convalescence, commencing about five years ago, continued for
more than three years, which I attribute to the absence of causes
of irritation, more delicate and attentive treatment, and
constant resources of various amusements.&nbsp; During the whole
of this time, he could not be persuaded to leave the place; he
said &ldquo;It would not do;&rdquo; that he &ldquo;should soon be
worse than ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name of home and his wife
seemed to make him shudder; and when asked if he should not like
to go, he shook his head, turned away, and said nothing; but he
evidently painfully felt the association of old exciting
causes.</p>
<p>It ought, however, to be mentioned that during the whole of
this time he would frequently exhibit signs of great uneasiness
and irritability, would pace the gallery or airing court, in
quick and hurried steps, and afterwards call his attendants to
play a game at whist or backgammon: at these times he was in the
habit of chewing orange-peel, which he constantly carried in his
pocket for that purpose, and afterwards he would say his troubles
were overcome.&nbsp; He has since had a return of his insanity,
from which he never perfectly recovered; I have since understood
that he is dead.</p>
<h4><a name="page2_202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>OBSERVATION XIX.</h4>
<p>The most obvious remark suggested by this case is, that, like
many old cases, when once an irritable habit is established in
any part of the mind, how easily the mere association of old
existing causes will overturn the balance and introduce a relapse
into the same state: no exciting causes can have more power to do
this, than the constant painful state of mind which ill-assorted
and unhappy marriages produce; and therefore, the next most
obvious remark suggested by this case, is the evil which arises
from the whole mind being ultimately disagreeably affected by the
contraction of hasty, mistaken, and ill-assorted matrimonial
connexions.&nbsp; As the sublime principle of rightly-constituted
and spiritual or mental marriage is involved in the consideration
of such cases; and as, from the want of a proper understanding of
this principle being duly impressed upon mankind, the evils and
miseries which the parties bring upon themselves and entail upon
their offspring in the world, are so numerous and so frightful,
and so frequently the cause of the most terrible forms of
insanity, I shall, in an after part of this work, endeavour to
embody in an essay expressly on this subject, all the arguments
which I can <a name="page2_203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>bring forth, for the purpose of enforcing this first,
this inmost, this greatest, grandest principle involving the
happiness and well-being of the world.</p>
<h3><i>No.</i> 31.&mdash;<i>Admitted</i> 1808.&mdash;<i>Aged</i>
30.</h3>
<p>He is a surgeon, and was formerly in great repute as a
successful practitioner, as well as a lecturer on anatomy,
surgery, and the practice of physic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>He was very studious, and chiefly during the night, though his
sleep was already sufficiently broken by his professional
labour.&nbsp; As a young student he was ambitious to excel, as he
would often say, &ldquo;I employed my time well, that it might
serve me in after life; and it did so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind is naturally one of much greater activity than power,
hence his harassing day and night practice and preparation for
lecturing induced a morbid state of mind, in which condition a
fever in his family occurred.&nbsp; Rapidly and unexpectedly,
four male children, a niece, and a maid-servant, were the
victims, and this completed the wreck of his overworked, active,
and feeling mind.</p>
<p>His present state is most interesting and singular, and very
difficult to describe.&nbsp; His activity <a
name="page2_204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>of mind,
prodigious command of words, and most animated and graceful
manner, excite the greatest surprise; and even in his present
deranged and deluded condition, with his varied stores of
information, these exhibitions are mistaken for the remnants of
versatility of genius; yet, as I have already said, it is most
true that his mind was not naturally one of so much power as it
was of amazing ambition and activity.</p>
<p>He will suddenly rush into some of his anatomical, surgical,
and medical lectures, going through different parts of the human
body, operations, and practice.&nbsp; His lectures on the
circulation of the blood, seem to have been most strongly
impressed upon his memory.&nbsp; At other times, his eloquence is
displayed in imitations of various celebrated characters.&nbsp;
If they are ancients, and he be asked, how can this be? since
they lived two thousand years ago, he says: &ldquo;Yes, but I
died and rose again in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus, he
imagines himself every character he personifies, and that at that
time he was alive, and afterwards died, again reappearing in such
another character.&nbsp; In this way having passed through
numberless transmigrations, he was Adam, Abel, or Melchisadeck,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Samson, Goliah, David,
and Solomon.&nbsp; Solomon had great attractions: frequently
describing, with great animation, his state of grandeur <a
name="page2_205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>and
enjoyment.&nbsp; In the same way he was Aristotle, Pythagoras,
Confucius, Plato, Zoroaster, Pliny, Ptolemy, Cicero, Demosthenes,
and particularly Homer, Mahomet, and even our Saviour,
&amp;c.&nbsp; All these he will still personate, and make
speeches differing in manner and matter, and suitable in some
measure to each of them.</p>
<p>In medicine, all the list of celebrated men are claimed as the
same transmigration of his soul.&nbsp; He lifted up the
serpent.&nbsp; He was Hypocrates, Celsus, Galen, Paracelsus,
Stahl, Van Helmont, Boerhave, Cullen.&nbsp; In anatomy, surgery,
chemistry, and natural philosophy, it was the same.&nbsp; The
whole list of celebrated medical men is monopolized by this mania
of transmigration.</p>
<p>He always addressed strangers as contemporaries, saying,
&ldquo;Good God! you were alive at such a time: I knew you well;
you were with me when I conquered at the plains of Marathon! or,
you met me at such a place when I was singing the Iliad, as old
Homer,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; All this with such a fascination
of look, manner, and address, that he arrests and amuses every
one, especially strangers.&nbsp; He frequently talks with
imaginary, and especially angelic beings, which he does with a
manner and expression that prove he believes he beholds their
actual presence.</p>
<p>He had a peculiarly bright and glistening eye, <a
name="page2_206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>indicative of the secret and destructive habit so
dreadfully fatal to the insane.</p>
<p>It appeared to me, since amidst all this strange confusion and
delusion, his intellectual powers were still in existence, that
if his understanding could be constantly occupied, this confused
condition might in time be corrected, and his mind restored to a
right state: for this purpose I undertook to make him translate a
French work, while I wrote from his dictation, at the same time
checking and controlling his wild starts into all these
vagaries.&nbsp; In this manner we nearly finished an important
medical work together, and he was evidently much improved by the
exercise; the task was however so amazingly arduous, that in the
midst of my other duties I was obliged to discontinue it, and he
then relapsed into his former state.</p>
<p>The effect, however, was sufficiently decided to prove a fact
of very great importance, and many such facts having since
occurred, which further tend to confirm that many cases which are
generally given over as incurable, may be cured by a
well-directed exercise of the understanding, by which it is at
once strengthened, and the mind drawn and excluded from the
exercise of its insane feelings and hallucinations.&nbsp; In some
cases I have made them translate a work on the nature and effects
of <i>their secret vice</i>, and it has silently checked this
habit, and at last restored them.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page2_207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>Here I close my description of these old cases,
conceiving I have given a sufficient number for the purpose I had
in view, that of exhibiting a fair average picture of the state
and character of the old insane.&nbsp; After one general abstract
observation on the whole essay, I shall afterwards, and following
this last case, make my next essay on the origin and nature of
disease in general, and of insanity in particular: and which I
shall do as preliminary to the more intimate and direct
investigation of the causes and nature of insanity; and
especially the direct consideration of the cause to which I have
alluded in this case, because it is one of the most general and
most fatal causes of insanity, and a cause, which if not removed,
inevitably renders them incurable.&nbsp; Such was the habit of
the person whose case obliged me very reluctantly to assume a
defensive attitude, and refute falsehood by a statement of the
truth, or otherwise I should have continued silently to proceed
in the path of duty, without obtruding our own secret exertions
on the notice of the public, as it may appear that I have done in
this essay, as well as in those which are to follow, written, as
they will be, in some measure <a name="page2_208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>on the same principle, for the truth
should not suffer from diffidence, any more than it ought to be
brought into disrepute by vain ostentation; still, I am quite
certain, that I am actuated by no feelings incompatible with
charity and justice.</p>
<h3><a name="page2_209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS.</h3>
<p>The concluding general observations on this Essay and its
Appendix, are, that the one principal object I have had
constantly in view, has been the removal of the erroneous
impressions and prejudices which exist almost universally against
the insane, as if they alone were all furious wild beasts or
infernal demons, and which have hitherto excited and still
continue to excite a spirit and conduct toward them, productive
of a baneful and injurious influence.</p>
<p>So long as these prejudices exist in the mind, even the
soothing treatment which is now so much the boast of the age,
assumes a spirit and manner, perhaps as galling and injurious to
the afflicted as was, undoubtedly, the heartless tyranny of
former times.</p>
<p>I deprecate that altered tone of voice and manner which
implies in every word and action, that they are considered either
as children, or as beings wholly bereft of rationality.</p>
<p>In the system (which I have in some degree stated and
explained) of receiving and treating them as visitors, even as
though they were still <a name="page2_210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>rational, and of course observing
towards them the same polite and delicate attentions as are
practised in well-bred society, the same irresistible effects
which precept and example always produce in every sphere, in
proportion as they are exercised in sincerity and truth, will be
found to be produced also on them; and hence we may easily
perceive how it comes to pass that we have so much greater
dependence on their attachment, good conduct, fidelity, and
honour, than is generally imagined to be possible, and why,
consequently, the greater liberty which is given them is seldom
or never abused; and, as cause and effect increase each other, it
is evident that this system, by exciting and exercising the
higher feelings and moral principles of the mind, produces, (as
will be seen from the tables I shall hereafter introduce) a much
greater proportion of cures than has hitherto been the
case.&nbsp; It is much more conducive to cure than the system of
perfect separation and exclusion from any association.&nbsp; This
truth is another important reason for being anxious, from the
best of motives, to remove these baneful prejudices which have
hitherto made a marked moral line of distinction between diseases
of the brain, and other parts of the system, exclusively and
absurdly making the former a proof of some shameful
criminality.&nbsp; And though this greater degree of well-judged
<a name="page2_211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>liberty (not indiscriminate) appears alarming to those
who retain the usual worldly prejudices against the insane, it is
in reality attended with much less of danger or of any thing to
excite the fears of others, than most assuredly is a contrary
system.</p>
<p>I am now enabled, from nearly twenty years&rsquo; experience,
to say this with confidence; and I am the more anxious to impress
this on the world, in order that I may not be obliged, from too
great a deference to its fears and prejudices, to abridge the
exercise of this influence, so far as to lessen the happy effects
of a system which theory and feeling have suggested and compelled
me to pursue, and which increased knowledge and experience have
confirmed and justified.</p>
<p>Our fears and prejudices create and realize that which would
otherwise have no existence.&nbsp; We often blame effects of
which we ourselves are the cause.&nbsp; This is one principal, if
not the only, source of all our complaints and all our
troubles.&nbsp; Servants, children, families, sects, parties,
nations, and even the insane, are more or less good or bad in
their conduct and character, in proportion as our principles and
conduct towards them are under the influence of a wrong spirit or
a right one.</p>
<p>Such are our views, and I trust it will be seen (the
experimental part at least,&mdash;the <a
name="page2_212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>theory
will be explained in due course) that we have endeavoured,
however imperfectly, to reduce them to practice.</p>
<p>Wherever natural and spiritual good exist, there we shall
behold those best fruits of charity, of which the vine and
fig-tree are beautifully appropriate emblems.</p>
<p>I trust that what I have advanced will be considered less as a
personal boast than as an explanatory statement, suggested by
recognised evils, and enhanced by candour and conviction.&nbsp;
Although past conduct is the best guarantee for the future, yet
it is by no means an infallible security; and it altogether
ceases to be the test of any security, the moment boasting,
pride, or self-confidence exclude a higher and better
dependence.</p>

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
